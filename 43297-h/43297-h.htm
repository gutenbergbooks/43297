<p class="caption2"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</p>


<p>Both as raw materials and in the form of pottery,
bricks, tiles, terra-cotta and many other articles
of use and ornament, clays are amongst the most
important rock products. Yet the origin of the
substances we know as 'clay,' the processes occurring
in its formation and the causes of some of the most
important of its characteristics are of such a nature
that it is remarkable that its use should have become
so extended in the arts and sciences, while we know
so little of its properties when in a pure state.</p>

<p>In the following pages an attempt has been made
to state in a simple form an outline of our present
knowledge of the subject and to indicate the problems
which still lie before us.</p>

<p>The experimental solution of these problems is
rendered peculiarly difficult by the inertness of the
materials at ordinary temperatures and the ease with
which the clay molecule appears to break down into
its constituent oxides at temperatures approaching
red heat or as soon as it begins to react with alkaline
or basic materials.</p>

<p>Another serious difficulty is the highly complex
nature of that property known as 'plasticity' to which
many clays owe their chief value. For many years
this has been regarded as an elementary property such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
as hardness, cohesion or colour, but it is now known
to be of so elusive a nature as almost to defy
measurement with any degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>The thoroughness with which the methods of
physical chemistry have been applied to geological
and mineralogical problems during recent years has
been of very great assistance to the student of clay
problems, as will be seen on studying some of the
works mentioned in the short bibliography at the
end of the present volume. When the principles of
hydrolysis, ionization, mass reaction and reactional
velocity have been applied in still further detail to
the study of clays, our knowledge of their natural
history will increase even more rapidly than it has
done during the past few years.</p>

<p>No industry exercises so great a fascination over
those engaged in it as do the various branches of
clayworking; no other substance offers so many
problems of such absorbing interest to the artist, the
craftsman, the geologist, the chemist and the general
student of nature, whilst the differences in legal
opinion as to the nature of clay could themselves
occupy a volume far larger than the present one.</p>

<p class="caption3">INTRODUCTION. THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF CLAY</p>


<p>The chief uses of clay have been recognized
since the earliest periods of civilization; the ancient
Assyrian and Egyptian records contain numerous
references to the employment of clay for the manufacture
of bricks and for fulling or whitening cloth.</p>

<p>Clays are distributed so widely and in many cases
are so readily accessible that their existence and
some of their characteristics are known in entirely
uncivilized regions. The use of certain white clays
as a food, or at any rate as a means of staving off
hunger, is common among some tribes of very
primitive peoples. The more important uses of
clays for building and other purposes are naturally
confined to the more civilized nations.</p>

<p>The term <i>clay</i> (A.S. <i>cloeg</i>; Welsh <i>clai</i>; Dutch
<i>kley</i>) although used in a scientific sense to include
a variety of argillaceous earths (Fr. <i>argile</i> = clay)
used in the manufacture of bricks, tiles, pottery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and ceramic products (Gr. <i>keramos</i> = potter's earth)
generally, is really a word of popular origin and use.
Consequently, it is necessary to bear in mind, when
considering geological or other problems of a scientific
nature, that this term has been incorporated into
scientific terminology and that its use in this connection
not infrequently leads to confusion. In short,
whilst almost every dictionary includes one or more
definitions of clay, and most text-books on geology,
mineralogy, and allied sciences either attempt a
definition or assume the reader's knowledge of one,
there is no entirely satisfactory limitation in regard
to the substances which may or may not be included
under the term.</p>

<p><i>Clay</i> is a popular term for a variety of substances
of very varied origins, of great dissimilarity in their
composition and in many of their chemical and
physical properties, and differing greatly in almost
every conceivable respect. It is commonly supposed
that all clays are plastic, but some of the purest china
clays are almost devoid of this property and some of
the most impure earths used for brickmaking possess
it in a striking degree. Shales, on the one hand&mdash;whilst
clearly a variety of clay&mdash;are hard and
rock-like, requiring to be reduced to powder and very
thoroughly mixed with water before they become
plastic; many impure surface deposits, on the other
hand, are so highly plastic as to necessitate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
addition of other (sandy) materials before they can be
used for the manufacture of bricks and tiles.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to include in the term
clay 'all minerals capable of becoming plastic when
moistened or mixed with a suitable quantity of water,'
but this definition is so wide as to be almost impracticable,
and leads to the inclusion of many
substances which have no real connection with clays.
The limitation of the use of the word 'clay' to the
plastic or potentially plastic materials of any single
geological epoch is also impracticable, for clays appear
to have been deposited in almost every geological
period, though there is some difference of opinion as
to the time of the formation of certain clays known
as <i>kaolins</i>.</p>

<p>Clay is not infrequently termed a <i>mineral</i>, but
this does not apply at all accurately to the many
varieties of earths known as 'common clays,' which,
together with the 'boulder clays,' contain many
minerals and so cannot, as a whole, be included under
this term.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the legal significance of the
term 'mineral'&mdash;which has an important economic
bearing on account of minerals being taxed or
'reserved' in some instances where non-minerals
(including brick clay) are exempt&mdash;there can be no
doubt that, scientifically, clay is <i>not a mineral but a
rock</i>. Whatever mineral (if any) may give the chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
characteristic property to the clays as a class must be
designated by a special title, for the general term
'clay' will not serve for this purpose. Geologically,
the clays are sedimentary rocks, some being unaltered,
whilst others&mdash;the slates&mdash;are notably metamorphosed
and can seldom be used for the purposes for which
clays are employed.</p>

<p>Most clays may be regarded as a mixture of
quartz grains, undecomposed rock débris and various
decomposition products of rocks; if the last-named
consists chiefly of certain hydrous alumino-silicates,
they may be termed 'clay substance' (see <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter <span class="smcap">VI</span></a>).
The imperfections of this statement as a definition
are obvious when it is remembered that it may include
a mixture of fine sand and clay containing only 30 per
cent. of the latter substance.</p>

<p>It is, at the present time, quite impossible to
construct an accurate definition of the term 'clay.'
The most satisfactory hitherto published defines 'clay'
as 'a solid rock composed mainly of hydro-alumino-silicates
or alumino-silicic acids, but often containing
large proportions of other materials; the whole
possessing the property of becoming plastic when
treated with water, and of hardening to a stone-like
mass when heated to redness.'</p>

<p>From what has already been written, it will be
understood that there is no such entity as a standard
clay, for the varieties are almost endless, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
differences between them are sometimes so slight as
to be scarcely distinguishable.</p>

<p>A further consideration of this branch of the
subject may, however, conveniently be deferred to a
subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>The best-known clays are the surface clays,
loams and marls, the shales and other sub-surface
clays, and the pottery and china clays. The values
of these different materials vary enormously, some
being almost worthless whilst others are highly
valued.</p>

<p>The <i>surface clays</i> are chiefly used for the manufacture
of bricks and tiles (though some are quite
unsuitable for this purpose) and form the soil employed
in agriculture in many districts.</p>

<p>The <i>sub-surface clays</i> and <i>shales</i> are harder, and
usually require mechanical treatment before they can
be used for brick and terra-cotta manufacture, or for
the production of refractory and sanitary articles.</p>

<p>The <i>pottery and china clays</i> are usually more
free from accessory constituents, and are regarded as
the 'purest' clays on the market, though a considerable
amount of latitude must be allowed in interpreting
the term 'pure.' China clays are by no means pure
in the state in which they occur, and require careful
treatment before they can be sold.</p>

<p>Further information with regard to the characteristics
of certain clays will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter <span class="smcap">V</span></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Chemical Properties of Clay.</span></p>

<p>The chief constituents of all clays are alumina
and silica, the latter being always in excess of the
former. These two oxides are, apparently, combined
to form a hydro-alumino-silicate or alumino-silicic
acid corresponding to the formula H<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, but
many clays contain a much larger proportion of silica
than is required to form this compound, and other
alumino-silicates also occur in them in varying proportions
(see Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_V"><span class="smcap">V</span></a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VI"><span class="smcap">VI</span></a>).</p>

<p>All clays may, apparently, be regarded as consisting
of a mixture of one or more hydrous alumino-silicates
with free silica and other non-plastic minerals
or rock granules, and their chemical properties are
largely dependent on the nature and proportion of
these accessory ingredients.</p>

<p>The purest forms of clay (china clays and ball
clays) approximate to the formula above-mentioned,
but others differ widely from it, as will be seen from
the analyses on <a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>. The chemical properties of
pure clay are described more fully in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter <span class="smcap">VI</span></a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

although this is a convenient arrangement, it must not be understood

that in such substances as washing soda&mdash;Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>24H<sub>2</sub>O, or zinc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>

<p>Taking china clay, which has been carefully purified
by levigation, as representative of the composition of
a 'pure' clay, it will be found that the chief impurities
in clays are (<i>a</i>) stones, gravel and sand&mdash;removable by
washing or sifting; (<i>b</i>) felspar, mica and other silicates
and free silica&mdash;which cannot be completely removed
without affecting the clay and (<i>c</i>) lime, magnesia, iron,
potash and soda compounds, together with minute
quantities of other oxides, all of which appear to be
so closely connected with the clay as to be incapable
of removal from it by any mechanical methods of
purification.</p>

<p>To give a detailed description of the effect of each
of the impurities just referred to would necessitate a
much larger volume than the present, but a few brief
notes on the more important ones are essential to
a further consideration of the natural history of
clay.</p>

<p><i>Stones</i>, <i>gravel</i> and <i>sand</i> are most noticeable in
the boulder clays, but they occur in clays of most
geological ages, though in very varying proportions.
Sometimes the stones are so large that they may be
readily picked out by hand; in any case the stones,
gravel and most of the sand may be removed by
mixing the material with a sufficient quantity of water
and passing the 'slip' through a fine sieve, or by
allowing it to remain stationary for a few moments
and then allowing the supernatant liquid to run off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
into a settling tank. Some clays contain sand grains
which are so fine that they cannot be removed in this
manner and the clay must then be washed out by a
stream of water with a velocity not exceeding 2 ft.
per hour. Even then, the clay so removed may be
found to contain minute grains of silt, much of which
may be removed by a series of sedimentations for
various periods, though a material perfectly free from
non-plastic granules may be unattainable.</p>

<p>Most of the sand found associated with clays is in
the form of fragments of <i>quartz</i> crystals (<a href="#Fig_1">fig. 1</a>), though
it may be composed of irregular particles of other
minerals or of amorphous silica.</p>

<p><i>Felspar</i>, <i>mica</i> and other adventitious silicates
occur in many natural clays in so fine a state of
division that their removal would be unremunerative.
In addition to this they act as fluxes when the clays
are heated in kilns, binding the less fusible particles
together and forming a far stronger mass than would
otherwise be produced. Consequently, they are
valuable constituents in clays used for the manufacture
of articles in which strength or imperviousness
is important. If these minerals are present in the
form of particles which are sufficiently large to be
removed by elutriation in the manner described on
the previous page, the purification of the clay is not
difficult. Usually, however, the most careful treatment
fails to remove all these minerals; their presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
may then be detected by microscopical examination
and by chemical analysis. For most of the purposes
for which clays are used, small proportions of these
silicates are unimportant, but where clays of a highly
refractory nature are required; and for most of the
purposes for which china clays (kaolins) are employed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
they must not be present to the extent of more
than 5 per cent., smaller proportions being preferable.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Oxides</i>, <i>sulphides</i>, <i>sulphates</i> and <i>carbonates</i> of
various metals form the third class of impurities in
clays. Of these, the most important are calcium
oxide (lime), calcium carbonate (chalk and limestone),
calcium sulphate (gypsum and selenite), the corresponding
magnesia, magnesium carbonate, and sulphate,
the various iron oxides, ferrous carbonate and
iron sulphides (pyrite and marcasite) (<a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>).</p>

<p>Potash and soda compounds are commonly present
as constituents of the felspar, mica, or other silicates
present, and need no further description, though small
proportions of <i>soluble salts</i>&mdash;chiefly sodium, potassium,
calcium and magnesium sulphates&mdash;occur in most
clays and may cause a white scum on bricks and
terra-cotta made from them.</p>

<p><i>Lime and magnesia compounds</i> may occur as
silicates (varieties of felspar, mica, etc.), but their most
important occurrence is as chalk or limestone. <i>Chalk</i>
is a constant constituent of malms<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and of many marls,
but the latter may contain limestone particles. <i>Limestone</i>
occurs in many marls and to a smaller extent
in other clays. In the boulder clays it frequently
forms a large portion of the stony material. If the
grains are very small (as in chalk), the lime compounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
act as a flux, reducing the heat-resisting power of the
clay and increasing the amount of vitrification; they
produce in extreme cases a slag-like mass when the
clay is intensely heated. If, on the contrary, the
grains are larger (as frequently occurs with limestone),
they are converted into lime or magnesia when the
clay is 'burned' in a kiln, and the lime, on exposure
to weather, absorbs moisture (<i>i.e. slakes</i>), swells, and
may disintegrate the articles made from the clay.
Limestone (except when in a very finely divided state)
is almost invariably objectionable in clays, but chalk
is frequently a valuable constituent.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A <i>malm</i> is
a natural mixture of clay and chalk (<a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>Chalk is added to clay in the manufacture of
malm-bricks to produce a more pleasing colour than
would be obtained from the clay alone, to reduce the
shrinkage of the clay to convenient limits and, less
frequently, to form a more vitrifiable material. Chalk,
on heating, combines with iron oxide and clay, forming
a white silicate, so that some clays which would, alone,
form a red brick, will, if mixed with chalk, form a
white one.</p>

<p>Lime compounds have the serious objection of
acting as very rapid and powerful fluxes, so that
when clays containing them are heated sufficiently to
start partial fusion, a very slight additional rise in
temperature may easily reduce the whole to a shapeless,
slag-like mass. Magnesia compounds act much
more slowly in this respect and so are less harmful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gypsum</i>&mdash;a calcium sulphate&mdash;occurs naturally
in many sub-surface clays, often in well-defined
crystalline masses. It reduces the heat-resisting
power of the clays containing it and may, under some
conditions, rise to the surface of the articles made
from the clay, in the form of a white efflorescence or
scum, such as is seen on some brick walls.</p>

<p><i>Iron compounds</i> are highly important because
they exercise a powerful influence on the colour of
the burned clays. The red oxide (ferric oxide) is the
most useful form in burned clay, but in the raw
material ferrous oxide and ferrous carbonate may
also occur, though they are converted into the red
oxide on heating. The red iron oxide, which is
closely related to 'iron rust,' occurs in so finely
divided a state that its particles appear to be almost
as small as those of the finest clays. Hence attempts
to improve the colour of terra-cotta and bricks by
the addition of commercial 'iron oxide' are seldom
satisfactory, the finest material obtainable being far
coarser than that occurring in clays.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that red iron oxide does not
appear to form any compound with the other constituents
of clay under ordinary conditions of firing,
and although a 'base' and capable of reducing the
heat-resisting power of clays, it does not appear to do
so as long as the conditions in the kiln are sufficiently
oxidizing. It is this which enables red bricks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
other articles to be obtained with remarkable uniformity
of colour combined with great physical
strength. In a reducing atmosphere, on the contrary,
ferrous oxide readily forms and attacks the clay,
forming a dark grey vitreous mass. If the iron
particles are separated from each other they will,
on reduction, form small slag-like spots, but if they
are in an extremely fine state of division and well
distributed, the brick or other article will become
slightly glossy and of an uniform black-grey tint.
The famous Staffordshire 'blue' bricks owe their
colour to this characteristic; they are not really
'blue' in colour. The effect of chalk on the colour of
red-burning clays has already been mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Iron pyrite</i> (<a href="#Fig_2_3">fig. 2</a>) and <i>marcasite</i> (<a href="#Fig_2_3">fig. 3</a>)&mdash;both
of which are forms of iron sulphide&mdash;occur in many
clays, particularly those of the Coal Measures.
<i>Mundic</i> is another form of pyrites which resembles
roots or twigs, but when broken show a brassy
fracture. When in pieces of observable size the
pyrite may be readily distinguished by its resemblance
to polished brass and the marcasite by its tin-white
metallic lustre and both by their characteristic cubic,
root-like and spherical forms; the latter only show
a brass-like sheen when broken. Even when only
a small proportion of mundic, pyrite or marcasite is
present, it is highly objectionable for several reasons.
In the first place, half the sulphur present is given off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
at a dark red heat and is liable to cause troublesome
defects on the goods. Secondly, because the remaining
sulphur and iron are not readily oxidized, so
that there is a great tendency to form slag-spots of
ferrous silicate, owing to the iron attacking the clay
at the same moment as it parts with its remaining
sulphur. For this reason, clays containing any iron
sulphide seldom burn red, but form products of a
buff colour with black spots scattered irregularly over
their surface and throughout the mass&mdash;an appearance
readily observable on most hard-fired firebricks. If
chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) is present the
spots may be bright green in colour.</p>

<p><i>Carbon</i>, either free or as hydrocarbons (chiefly
vegetable matter) or in other forms, is a constituent
of most clays, though seldom reported in analyses.
Its presence exercises an important influence in
several respects. On heating the clay, with an ample
supply of air, the carbonaceous matter may distil off
(as shale oil), but more usually it decomposes and
burns out leaving pores in the material. If the air-supply
is insufficient and the heating is so rapid and
intense that vitrification commences before the carbon
is all burned away, the pores become filled with the
fused ingredients of the clay, air can no longer reach
the carbon particles and a black 'core' or heart
is produced. Under peculiarly disadvantageous conditions
the material may also swell greatly. This is
a serious defect in many classes of clay used for
brickmaking, and its causes and prevention have been
exhaustively studied by Orton and Griffiths (<a href="#Bibl_1">1</a>)<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but,
beyond the brief summary given above, these are
beyond the scope of the present work.</p>

<p><i>Water</i> is an essential constituent of all unburned
clays, though the proportion in which it occurs varies
within such wide limits that no definite standard can
be stated. This water is found in two conditions:
(<i>a</i>) as moisture or mechanically mixed with the clay
particles and (<i>b</i>) in a state of chemical combination.</p>

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Physical Characters of Clays.</span></p>

<p>The physical characters of clays are of far more
interest and importance than their chemical ones,
though the two are naturally connected in many
ways, and just as the chemical composition of clays
is a subject of extreme complexity so is a study of
many of their physical properties. Hence only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
few of the more important characteristics can be
mentioned here: for further details the reader must
consult a larger treatise (<a href="#Bibl_2">2</a>).</p>

<p>Clays are moderately soft, solid bodies, particularly
when moistened, and can usually be cut with
a knife, though some indurated clays and shales are
almost as hard as felspar. Their apparent specific
gravity varies greatly, some clays being much more
porous than others, but the true specific gravity is
usually between 2&middot;5 and 2&middot;65; it is similar to that of
quartz and slightly lower than that of felspar and
mica. Many clays appear to be devoid of structure,
but those obtained from a considerable depth below
the surface are frequently laminated and have a
structure not unlike that of mica. This will be
discussed later.</p>

<p>Examined under a microscope, clays are seen to
consist of grains of a variety of sizes, the largest of
which will usually be found to be composed of
adventitious materials such as sand, quartz, felspar,
mica, chalk and limestone. The smallest particles&mdash;to
which clays owe their chief characteristics&mdash;are
so minute as to make any examination of their
shape very difficult, but they are usually composed
of minute crystalline plates together with a much
larger proportion of apparently amorphous material.
The exact nature of both the crystals and the
amorphous material is still unknown in spite of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
investigations; in the purer clays both forms of
substance appear to have the same chemical composition,
viz. that of <i>kaolinite</i> (H<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>), which the
crystalline portion closely resembles.</p>

<p>Clays emit a characteristic yet indefinable odour
when moist; the cause of this is very imperfectly
understood, though it is not improbably due to
decomposing organic matter, as this occurs in most
clays.</p>

<p>The colours of freshly-dug clays are extremely
varied and range from an almost pure white through
all shades of yellow, red and brown to black. The
predominating colours are grey or greyish brown
and a peculiar yellow characteristic of some surface
clays. The natural colour of a clay is no criterion
as to its purity, for some of the darkest ball clays
produce perfectly white ware on burning, whilst
some of the paler clays are useless to the potter on
account of the intensity of their colour when they
come out of the kiln. The colour of raw clays is
largely due to the carbonaceous matter they contain,
and as this burns away in the kiln, the final colour
of the ware bears no relation whatever to that of the
original clay.</p>

<p>The colour of burned ware depends upon the iron
compounds in the clay&mdash;these producing buff, red,
brown or black (usually termed 'blue') articles&mdash;on the
presence of finely divided calcium carbonate (chalk)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which can destroy the colouring power of iron compounds
and produce white ware, and on the treatment
the clay has received in the kiln. A clay which is
white when underfired will usually darken in colour
if heated to vitrification, and one which burns red in
an oxidizing atmosphere may turn blue-grey or black
under reducing conditions. The extent to which the
carbonaceous matter is burned out also determines
the colour of the fired ware.</p>

<p>The presence of adventitious minerals in the clay
may also affect its colour, particularly when fired.</p>

<p>The most obvious feature in a piece of moist clay
is its <i>plasticity</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or ability to alter its shape when
kneaded or put under slight pressure and to retain
its new shape after the pressure has been removed.
It is this property which enables the production of
ornaments, vessels of various kinds, and the many
other articles which are the result of the application
of modelling tools, of moulding or of the action of a
potter's wheel. So long as clay contains a suitable
proportion of moisture it is plastic and may be made
into articles of any desired shape, but if the amount
of moisture in it is reduced or removed completely,
the material is no longer plastic. It may become so,
however, on adding a further suitable quantity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
water and mixing, provided that it has not been
excessively heated. If, in the removal of the moisture,
the clay has been heated to 600&deg; C. or more, it loses
its power of becoming plastic and is converted into
a material more closely resembling stone.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> A plastic substance is one with the characteristics of 'a fluid of
so great a viscosity that it does not lose its shape under the influence
of gravitation.'</p></div>

<p>The causes of plasticity appear to be somewhat
numerous, though there is no generally accepted
explanation of this remarkable quality which distinguishes
clays from most other substances. It is
true that wet sand, soap, wax, lead and some other
materials possess a certain amount of plasticity, but
not to anything like the same extent as clay.</p>

<p>So far as clays are concerned, their plasticity
appears to be connected with the presence of combined
water as well as of mechanically mixed water,
for if either of these are removed, plasticity&mdash;both
actual and potential&mdash;is destroyed. The part played
by water is not, however, completely known, for the
many theories which have been advanced only cover
some of the conditions and facts.</p>

<p>A number of observers agree that the molecular
constitution of clay is peculiar and that it is to this
that plasticity is due. Yet the curious fact that the
purest clays&mdash;the kaolins&mdash;are remarkably deficient
in plasticity shows that molecular constitution is not,
alone, sufficient. Others hold that the remarkably
small size of clay particles enables them to pack
together more closely than do particles of other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
materials and to retain around them a film of water
which acts partly as a lubricant, facilitating the
change of shape of the mass when under pressure,
and partly as an adhesive, causing the particles to
adhere to each other when the pressure is removed.</p>

<p>Zschokke has laid much emphasis on the importance
of molecular attraction between clay and
water as a cause of plasticity, and has suggested that
the absorption of the water effects a change in the
surfaces of the clay particles, giving them a gelatinous
nature and enabling them to change their form and
yet keep in close contact.</p>

<p>The fact that mica, fluorspar and quartz, when in a
sufficiently finely divided state, are also slightly plastic,
appears to be opposed to the molecular constitution
theory. Smallness of grain undoubtedly has an
influence on the plasticity of clay, coarse-grained
clays being notably less plastic than others.</p>

<p>Daubrée pointed out that felspar, when ground
with water, develops plasticity to a small extent, and
Olschewsky carried this observation further and has
suggested that clays owe their plasticity to prolonged
contact with water during their removal from their
place of formation and previous to or during their
deposition. A further confirmation of this theory is
due to Mellor (<a href="#Bibl_3">3</a>) who showed that on heating china
clay with water under very considerable pressure its
plasticity was increased and that felspar and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
other non-plastic materials developed plasticity under
these conditions.</p>

<p>Johnson and Blake (<a href="#Bibl_21">21</a>) supposed that plasticity is
due to the clay being composed of extremely minute
plates 'bunched together,' a view which was also
held by Biedermann and Herzfield, Le Chatelier and
others. Olschewsky enlarged this theory by suggesting
that the plasticity of certain clays is dependent on
the large surface and the interlocking of irregular
particles with the plates just mentioned. These
theories of interlocking are, however, incomplete,
because the tensile strength of clays should accurately
represent the plasticity if interlocking were the sole
cause. Zschokke has shown that tensile strength is
only one factor which must be determined in any
attempt to measure plasticity.</p>

<p>E. H. L. Schwarz (<a href="#Bibl_35">35</a>) has suggested that many
clays are composed of small globular masses of plates
so arranged as to form an open network (<a href="#Fig_4">fig. 4</a>) which
is sufficiently strong not to be destroyed by pressure.
In the presence of water and much rubbing the
plates are separated and are made to lie flat on each
other, thereby giving a plastic and impermeable mass.
If this is really the case it would explain the porosity
and large surface of some clays and might account
for their adsorptive power.</p>

</div>

<p>A theory which was first promulgated in 1850
by Way (<a href="#Bibl_4">4</a>), but which has only received detailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
attention during the last few years, attributes plasticity
to the presence of colloid substances in clay or to the
fact that clay particles possess physical characters
analogous to those of glue and other colloids. These
colloid substances have a submicroscopic or micellian
structure; they are web-like, porous and absorb water
eagerly. This water may be removed by drying,
only to be re-absorbed on cooling, but if the heating
temperature is excessive the structure of the colloids
is destroyed. This colloid theory explains many of
the facts noted by earlier investigators such as Aron,
Bischof, Seger, Olschewsky, etc., but it is not entirely
satisfactory, though Rohland (<a href="#Bibl_5">5</a>)&mdash;to whom the present
prominence of this theory in Europe is largely due&mdash;persistently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
maintains the contrary. One great objection
is the fact that no characteristic <i>inorganic</i>
colloid substance has been isolated from pure clay.
It is possible that some of the so-called 'colloidal'
properties of clay may be due to the smallness of its
particles and to their great porosity, as suggested by
Olschewsky.</p>

<p>Despite the present impossibility of producing
a plastic material from artificially prepared colloidal
hydro-alumino-silicates of the same ultimate composition
as clay, and the fact that the addition of
colloidal substances does not necessarily increase the
true plasticity of clay, it cannot be denied that the
presence of colloids has an important influence on
it. The addition of starches, glue, gums and similar
substances whilst apparently increasing the plasticity
of clay does not do so in reality. The addition of
1 per cent. of tannin, on the contrary, has been
found by Ries (<a href="#Bibl_6">6</a>) to increase both plasticity and
binding power.</p>

<p>Plasticity appears to be composed of a number of
characteristics so that it is scarcely likely that any
single cause can be assigned to it. On the contrary,
a study of the binding power, tensile strength, extensibility,
adsorption, texture and molecular constitution
of clays suggests very strongly that all these
properties are involved in the production of plasticity
and that it is due to the chemical as well as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
physical nature of clay. No clay is entirely colloidal&mdash;or
it would be elastic and not plastic&mdash;but all
appear to contain both colloidal and non-colloidal
(including plate-like) particles, and it is not improbable
that materials in both these states are required,
the colloidal matter acting as a cement. Ries (<a href="#Bibl_6">6</a>) has,
in fact, pointed out that colloids alone lack cohesiveness
and solidity, and a fine mineral aggregate is
necessary to change them into a plastic mass resembling
clay. The relative proportions of the colloidal
material and the sizes of the non-plastic grains will
exercise an important influence on all the physical
characteristics mentioned above, and therefore on the
plasticity.</p>

<p>The manner in which slightly plastic clays become
highly plastic in nature is by no means certainly
known. It has long been understood that the increase
of plasticity is due to changes undergone by the
clay during transportation. The most illuminating
suggestion is that made by Acheson in 1902, who
concluded that it is due to impurities in the water
used in transporting the clay or remaining in contact
with it during and after its deposition. These impurities
may be considered as derived from the
washings of forests, and after many experiments with
plant extracts Acheson believed the most important
substance in this connection to be tannin or gallo-tannic
acid, a dilute solution of which he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
increased the plasticity of china clay by 300 per cent.
From this he further argued that the use of chopped
straw by the Israelites in Egypt in the manufacture
of bricks was unconsciously based on the tannin
content of the straw increasing the plasticity of the
material.</p>

<p class="fig_caption">Fig. 5. Chart showing rates of drying. (<i>After Bleininger.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Beadle has stated that 2 per cent. of dissolved
cellulose will increase the plasticity of china clay and
make it equal to that of ordinary clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Plasticity is diminished by heating clays, and
whilst much of it may be recovered if the temperature
has not risen above 400&deg; C. it cannot be completely
restored. Moreover, a clay which has once been
heated to a temperature above 100&deg; C. dries in a
somewhat different manner to a raw clay. This is
well shown in <a href="#Fig_5">fig. 5</a> in which are summarized the
results obtained by A. V. Bleininger on a sample of
ball clay from Dorset before heating and after portions
of it had been heated for 16 hours to 200&deg;, 250&deg;, 300&deg;,
350&deg; and 400&deg; C. respectively. It is not impossible
that if subjected to the influence of water for a
sufficiently long time the whole of the plasticity of
a heated clay may be restored, providing that the
temperature has not been sufficient to cause a destruction
of the clay molecule, but as this resumption
requires a certain amount of time, Bleininger has
proposed to use the reduction in plasticity effected by
the heating to enable excessively plastic clays to be
worked without the necessity of adding non-plastic
material to them. If any destruction of the clay-molecules
has occurred, the plasticity of that portion
of the clay can never be restored.</p>

<p>The <i>binding power</i> of clays is a characteristic
closely connected with plasticity and occasionally
confused with it. All plastic clays have the power of
remaining plastic when mixed with materials such as
sand, brick-dust ('grog') and other materials which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
are quite devoid of plasticity. The extent to which
a clay can thus bind other materials together into a
plastic mass depends, apparently, on the plasticity
of the clay itself and on the size and nature of the
particles of the added material; the more plastic the
clay the larger will be the amount of material it can
thus 'bind,' and the finer the latter the more easily
will it form a strong material when mixed with a
plastic clay.</p>

<p>Rohland (<a href="#Bibl_5">5</a>) has shown that the binding power of
clay is not alone due to its cohesion, but that it is
closely associated with the colloidal nature of plastic
clays: 'fat' clays being those which are highly colloidal,
highly plastic and possessing great binding power,
whilst 'lean' clays are those deficient in these
characteristics. The fact that, as a general rule, the
dark coloured clays possess the most binding power,
confirms this suggestion, as the dark colour is largely
due to organic materials, probably in a colloidal
state.</p>

<p>The <i>shrinkage</i> which all clays undergo on drying
and when heated is another important characteristic.
It is due to the fact that as water is removed the
solid particles approach closer to each other, the
volume of the whole mass being thereby reduced.
In a wet piece of clay each particle is surrounded by
a film of water, the thickness of which depends on the
nature of the clay. As this water evaporates from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the surface of the clay its place is taken by water
from the interior which rises to the surface by capillary
attraction. So long as there is any water between
the particles of clay there will be shrinkage when this
water is removed, but a stage is eventually reached
when the particles of clay are in contact with each
other and no more shrinkage can occur. That this
cessation of shrinkage may take place before all the
water has been removed from the clay is easily
understood when it is remembered that whilst the
clay particles may be in contact, yet there are still
places (pores) where the contact is incomplete, and in
these pores water may be retained. The amount of
shrinkage clays undergo on drying depends partly on
the proportion of water added to them and partly on
the sizes of the different particles of clay, sand, etc.
present. An average reduction in volume of 12 to
38 per cent. may be regarded as normal, but coarse
loams may shrink only 1 per cent. and very finely
ground, highly plastic ball clays may shrink as much
as 50 per cent., though this is unusual.</p>

<p>As all coagulated colloids, which have absorbed
water, shrink on drying, this behaviour of clay
appears to confirm the view as to its partially colloidal
nature held by some investigators.</p>

<p>When a piece of dry clay is heated sufficiently
a further shrinkage (technically known as <i>kiln
shrinkage</i>) occurs. This begins somewhat below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a red heat and increases in rough proportion to the
temperature and the duration of the heating. Prolonged
heating at a lower temperature will effect the
same amount of shrinkage as a short exposure to
a higher temperature, but though the greater part of
the shrinkage occurs in a comparatively short time,
continued heating will be accompanied by a further
reduction in volume.</p>

<p>This is due to the fact that clays have no definite
melting point, but undergo partial fusion at all
temperatures above 950&deg; C. or, in some cases, at even
lower ones. As a portion of the material fuses, it
fills up the pores in the mass and attacks the unfused
material, this process being continued until either the
heating is stopped or the whole material is reduced
to a viscous slag.</p>

<p>The reduction in the volume of commercial articles
made of clay and placed in kilns varies greatly.
With bricks, terra-cotta and pottery it must not,
usually, exceed 40 per cent. or the warping and
cracking which occur will be so great as to make the
articles useless. The fineness of the particles exercises
an important influence on the kiln shrinkage of a clay,
and the latter is frequently reduced in commercial
clayworking by adding burned clay ground to a coarse
powder to the plastic clay before it is used. Sand is
sometimes added for the same purpose, though its
more frequent use is to reduce the shrinkage in drying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Quartz and other forms of free silica expand on
heating, so that clays containing them in large
quantities shrink very slightly or may even expand.</p>

<p>As clays shrink equally in all directions it is usual
to state the contraction in linear instead of volume
form. Thus instead of stating that a certain clay
when moulded into bricks, dried and burned, shrinks
18 per cent. by volume, it is customary to state that it
shrinks <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in. per (linear) foot. For many purposes, it
is sufficient to regard the linear shrinkage as one-third
the volume-shrinkage, but this is not strictly
accurate.</p>

<p>The <i>fusibility</i> of clays is a characteristic which
has been very imperfectly studied. Most clayworkers
and investigators employ the term 'fusibility' in a
special sense which is apt to be misleading. Owing
to the extremely high temperatures to which refractory
clays can be heated without even losing their
shape, it is almost impossible to fuse them completely.
In addition to this, clays are not perfectly homogeneous
materials and some of their constituents melt at
lower temperatures than others. For this reason
a clay may show signs of fusion at 1100&deg; C., but it may
be heated for some hours at 1800&deg; C. and yet not be
completely melted! Consequently no single 'fusing
point' can be stated.</p>

<p>In practice, a suggestion made many years ago by
Seger (<a href="#Bibl_7">7</a>) is used; the clay to be tested is made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
into a small tetrahedron (<a href="#Fig_6">fig. 6</a>), heated slowly until it
bends over and the point of the test-piece is almost
on a level with the base. The temperature at which
this occurs is termed the 'fusing point' though it
really only indicates the heat-treatment which is
sufficient to soften the material sufficiently to cause
it to bend in the manner described. In spite of the
apparent crudeness of the test this 'softening point'
appears to be fairly constant for most refractory
clays.</p>

<p>The bending of a test-piece in this manner is the
result of the action of all fluxes<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in the clay, and as
this depends on the size of grain and the duration of
the heating above incipient fusion and does not give a
direct measure of temperature, nor is the softening
effect under one rate of rise in temperature the same
as that at another rate. Nevertheless a study of the
behaviour of various clays heated simultaneously is
valuable and the method forms a convenient means
of comparing different materials.</p>

<a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> For
fluxing materials see <a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The temperature may be measured by means of
a pyrometer, but for the reason just stated it is more
convenient and in some respects more accurate to use
standard mixtures known as Seger Cones (<a href="#Fig_6">fig. 6</a>), and
to state the softening point in terms of the 'cone'
which behaves like the clay being tested. A medium
fireclay will not soften below Seger Cone 26 (1650&deg; C.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and a really good one will have a softening point of
cone 34 or 35 (1750&deg; to 1800&deg; C.).</p>

<p>The <i>refractoriness</i> of a clay, or its resistance to
high temperatures, is an important requirement in
bricks required for furnace linings, in crucibles, gas
retorts and other articles used in the metallurgical
and other industries. The term is much abused and
is frequently understood to mean resistance to the
cutting action of flue gases and flame, the corrosive
action of slags, and the strains set up by the repeated
changes in temperature. This is unfortunate, for the
term refractoriness has a perfectly definite meaning
and should be employed exclusively to denote that a
given clay is capable of retaining its shape at a given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
temperature or under given conditions when heated
alone and without being subjected to any pressure.
In Great Britain there is no officially recognized
standard of minimum refractoriness<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, but where one
is required the suggested minimum of Seger Cone 26
(1650&deg; C.) made by E. Cramer (<a href="#Bibl_8">8</a>) is usually employed.
This is the recognized minimum in Germany for
fireclays, and though objections may be urged
against the use of Seger Cones as a standard, equally
forcible ones may be brought against making a
temperature-scale the basis of measurement. Under
present circumstances, however, it is necessary to
adopt one or other of these.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
 See <i>Refractory Clays</i>, <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter <span class="smcap">V</span></a>.</p></div>

<p>Various attempts have been made to ascertain
the relationship (if any) between the refractoriness of
clays and their chemical composition. If attention is
confined strictly to the more refractory clays, some
kind of relationship does appear to exist. Thus
Richter found that the refractoriness of clay is influenced
by certain oxides in the following order:
magnesia, lime, ferrous oxide, soda and potash, but
this only applies to clays containing less than 3 per
cent. of all these oxides. Cramer, in 1895, found that
free silica also interfered with the action of these
oxides and more recently Ludwig (<a href="#Bibl_9">9</a>) has devised a
chart (<a href="#Fig_7">fig. 7</a>), on the upright sides of which are plotted
the equivalents of the lime, magnesia and alkalies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
whilst the silica equivalents are plotted on the horizontal
base. In each case the 'molecular formula' of
the clay is calculated from its percentage composition,
and this 'formula' is reduced so as to have one 'molecule'
of alumina, thereby fixing the alumina as a
constant and reducing the number of variables to
two&mdash;the metallic oxides and the silica. Unfortunately
Ludwig's chart is only applicable to the more refractory
clays and cannot be relied upon even for these, though
it is extremely useful for comparing clays from
identical or similar geological formations.</p>

<p>Attempts to express the refractoriness of clays
by means of formulae proving abortive, there only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
remains the direct test of heating a clay under definite
conditions in the manner previously described.</p>

<p><i>Vitrification</i> is closely connected with the fusibility
and refractoriness of clays, and, as a term, indicates
the amount of fusion which has occurred under certain
conditions of heating. As already mentioned, all
clays, on being subjected to a high temperature,
undergo partial fusion, the more powerful bases
attacking the finest particles of clay and silica,
forming molten silicates, and then slowly attacking
the more refractory portion; this slow fusion and
solution continues until the whole of the material is
melted. If the heating is stopped before the fusion
has begun, the clay will be porous and comparatively
soft, but as more and more material fuses, the mass
(on cooling) becomes harder and less porous, as the
fused material occupies the pores and sets to a dense,
firm glassy mass. The amount of vitrification, or
partial fusion, which occurs is, therefore, of great
importance in some industries, as by stopping it at
an appropriate stage articles of any desired degree of
porosity, translucency or strength may be obtained.
Thus for common bricks, only sufficient vitrification is
permitted to bind the particles firmly together, but
in engineering bricks&mdash;where much greater strength
is required&mdash;the vitrification is more complete.
Porcelain and earthenware may be similarly distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The extent to which a given clay will vitrify
depends on the amount of fluxing material (metallic
compounds, and oxides other than ferric oxide and
alumina) it contains, on the smallness of its particles
and on the duration and intensity of the heating.
Clays containing alkalies and lime compounds vitrify
with great rapidity when once the necessary temperature
has been reached, so that unless great care is
exercised the action will proceed too far and the
goods will be warped and twisted or may even form
a rough slag. Refractory clays, on the contrary,
vitrify more slowly and at much higher temperatures
so that accidental overheatings of them are far less
common.</p>

<p>The difference between the temperature at which
sintering or vitrification occurs and that at which
the clay melts completely&mdash;usually termed the 'vitrification
range'&mdash;varies with the nature of the clay.
In some cases the clay melts as soon as vitrification
becomes noticeable, in others the vitrification occurs
at a dull red heat, but the material does not lose its
shape until after a prolonged heating at the highest
temperature of a firebrick kiln or testing furnace.</p>

<p>Calcareous clays have the melting and sintering
points close together, so that it is almost impossible
to produce vitrified and impervious ware from them,
as they lose their shape too readily. If, however,
the difference between the sintering and fusing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
temperatures can be enlarged&mdash;that is, if the vitrification
range can be extended&mdash;more impervious ware
can be made. The easiest means of extending the
vitrification range consists in regulating the proportion
of large and small particles. The former
increase and the latter diminish the range.</p>

<p>Basic compounds and fluxes cause a lowering of
the melting-point and a shortening of the vitrification
range.</p>

<p>The <i>porosity</i> of raw clay is usually of small
importance, but the porosity of fired clay or ware is
often a serious factor in determining the suitability of
certain articles for their intended purposes. In its
natural state, clay does not readily absorb much
water; on the contrary it becomes pasty and
impervious unless it is disturbed and its texture
destroyed, when it may be mixed with water to form
a paste or, with more water, a thin 'cream' or 'slurry.'</p>

<p>When heated moderately, clay forms a porous
material and, unless the heating is excessive, it will
absorb about one-eighth of its weight of water.
Further heating at a higher temperature reduces its
porosity&mdash;the more easily fused material filling some
of the pores&mdash;until a stage is reached when the
material is completely vitrified and is no longer
porous.</p>

<p>Porosity may thus be regarded as the opposite of
vitrification; porous goods being relatively light and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
soft whilst vitrified ones are dense and hard. For
some purposes, porosity is an important characteristic:
for example, building bricks which are
moderately porous are preferable to those which are
vitrified. The manufacture of porous blocks for the
construction of light, sound-proof partitions, etc. has
increased rapidly of late. They are made by adding
sawdust or other combustible material to the clay.
The added substances burn out on firing the goods
in a kiln.</p>

<p>Clays which are porous can be dried more readily
and with less risk of cracking than those which are
more dense. For this reason, some clayworkers mix
non-plastic material such as sand or burned clay with
their raw material.</p>

<p>The <i>impermeability</i> of plastic clay to water is a
characteristic which is important for many purposes.</p>

<p>The <i>absorptive power</i> of clays is closely related
to their porosity so far as pure water is concerned,
but if the water contains certain salts in solution a
selective absorption occurs, the bases being retained
by the clay in such a manner that they cannot be
removed by washing. The selective action is known
as <i>adsorption</i> and is most noticeable in highly plastic
clays. Bourry (<a href="#Bibl_10">10</a>) has shown that the slightly
plastic china clays only exercise a small power of adsorbing
calcium carbonate from solution, but highly
plastic clays may adsorb 20 per cent. of it. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
alkaline chlorides and sulphates do not appear to be
adsorbed in this manner, but the carbonates are
readily removed from solution. All calcium and
magnesium compounds appear to be adsorbed, though
in variable quantities, the reaction being complicated
when several soluble salts are present. Ries (<a href="#Bibl_6">6</a>) has
found that gallo-tannic acid is adsorbed readily and
increases the plasticity of clay.</p>

<p>Ashley (<a href="#Bibl_11">11</a>) has endeavoured to measure the
plasticity of clays by determining their adsorption
capacity for various aniline dyes, but his untimely
decease prevented the investigation being completed.
There is reason to suppose that the relation between
adsorption and plasticity is extremely close in many
clays and that the former may, to an important
extent, be used as a measure of the latter. In some
clays, however, this relationship does not exist.</p>

<p>Sand and burned clay only show faint adsorption
phenomena; felspar shows them to a slight and
almost negligible extent and most of the other non-plastic
ingredients of clays are non-adsorptive.</p>

<p>Selective adsorption being an important characteristic
of colloidal substances, the possession of this
power by plastic clays supports the claim that
plasticity is due, at least in part, to the presence of
colloids.</p>

<p>The addition of small quantities of a solution of
certain substances to a stiff clay paste usually reduces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
its stiffness, and in some cases turns it into a liquid.
The alkalies are particularly powerful in this respect
and their action may be strikingly illustrated by mixing
a few drops of caustic soda with a stiff clay paste.
In a few moments the mixture will be sufficiently
liquid to pour readily, but it may be rendered quite
stiff again by adding sufficient acid to neutralize the
alkali previously used. Weber (<a href="#Bibl_12">12</a>) has utilized this
characteristic to great advantage in the production
of sanitary ware and crucibles for glass-making by a
process of casting which he has patented.</p>

<p>The effect of adding water to a dry clay is curious.
At first the particles in contact with the water become
sticky and plastic, and if the proportion of water
added is suitable and the mixing is sufficiently
thorough a plastic mass will be produced, the
characteristics of which will depend on the nature
of the clay used. This process of mixing clay with
a limited amount of water is known as 'tempering.'
The proportion of water required to make a paste
of suitable consistency for modelling appears to be
constant for each clay. If, however, a larger proportion
of water is added the particles of clay will be
separated so widely from each other that they lose
their cohesion, and instead of a plastic mass, the
material will form a liquid of cream-like consistency.
If a piece of stiff clay paste is suspended in a large
volume of water without stirring, disintegration will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
still occur (though a much longer time will be
required) and the clay will be deposited as a sediment
at the bottom of the vessel. The leaner the clay or
the larger the proportion of non-plastic material it
contains, the more rapidly will this disintegration take
place. A highly plastic clay will become almost
impervious and will retain its shape indefinitely.</p>

<p>If a mixture of clay and water in the form of a
cream or slurry be allowed to rest, the larger and
less plastic particles will settle, but many of the
particles of true clay will remain suspended for
several hours and some of them for several days.
Some particles of clay are so small that it is doubtful
if they would ever settle completely unless some
coagulant were added, and as they readily pass
through all ordinary filtering media it is extremely
difficult to collect them in a pure state. These turbid
suspensions of clay may be rapidly cleared by the
addition of sodium chloride which increases the
surface tension of the solution. The fine particles
behave in the same way as colloidal substances, <i>i.e.</i>
as if they possessed an electrostatic charge. Hence
the addition of a salt (electrolyte), whose ions annul
the opposite charges of the electric double layer
assumed by Helmholtz to be present, enables the
particles to coagulate in accordance with the ordinary
laws of surface tension (<a href="#Bibl_14">14</a>).</p>

<p><i>Exposure</i> to the action of air and frost has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
marked effect on many clays. When freshly dug
these may be hard and difficult to crush, but after
exposure they break up readily into small fragments.
Clays differ greatly in the extent to which they are
affected by exposure; some are completely disintegrated
by standing 48 hours in the open air,
whilst others are scarcely affected by exposure in
bleak places through several years of storm, sunshine
and frost. Usually, however, the effect of a couple
of nights exposure to hard frost will produce a
marked disintegration of the material.</p>

<p>This process of exposure is known as 'weathering'
and its effects are so important that it is employed
whenever possible for clays requiring to be crushed
before use. All clays are rendered more workable
by exposure, but some of them are damaged by the
oxidation of some impurities (<i>e.g.</i> pyrites) in them,
though in other clays this very oxidation, if followed
by the leaching action of rain, effects an important
purification of the material.</p>

<p>Weathering appears to have no effect on the
chemical composition of the particles of true clay in
the material, though it may decompose the impurities
present. On the clay itself its action is largely physical
and consists chiefly in separating the particles slightly
from each other, thereby enabling water to penetrate
the material more readily and facilitating the production
of a plastic paste. The disintegrating action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the weather on some 'clays' is so complete that
they require no crushing but can be converted into
a homogeneous paste by simply kneading them with
a suitable proportion of water.</p>

<p>It is possible that on exposure to the heat of the
sun's rays&mdash;particularly in tropical climates&mdash;some
chemical decomposition of the clay may occur, but
compared with the purely physical action of weathering
the amount of such chemical decomposition must
be relatively unimportant in most cases. It may,
however, account for the presence of free silica and
free alumina in some clays.</p>

<p>The action of the weather on rocks, resulting in
the formation of clays, is described in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter <span class="smcap">III</span>.</a></p>

<p><i>Heat</i> effects remarkable changes in the physical
character of clays; the most important of these have
already been noted. At a gentle heat, the clay is
dried and retains most of its power of becoming
plastic when moistened; very little, if any, decomposition
occurs. At a higher temperature it loses
its 'combined water,' the clay molecule apparently
dissociating, and a hard stony mass&mdash;consisting of
particles of free silica and free alumina cemented
together by the more easily fusible impurities
present&mdash;is formed. If the heating is continued the
hardness of the material is increased owing to more
molten silicate having been produced from the impurities
present, and on cooling, its tensile strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and resistance to crushing will be found to be
enormously greater than those of the original clay.
All potential plasticity is destroyed by heating to
700&deg; C. and no method of restoring it has yet been
devised. As clays are abundant, this is not a serious
disadvantage for the specially desired characteristics
of bricks, terra-cotta, pottery and porcelain are all
such as to be incompatible with plasticity. The
latter is extremely valuable in the shaping of the
wares mentioned, but after the manufacture is completed,
the destruction of the plasticity is an essential
feature of their usefulness.</p>

<p>If the heating is very prolonged or is repeated
several times, clays change other of their physical
characters and become brittle and liable to crack
under sudden changes of temperature. This is partly
due to the further fusion (vitrification) which occurs
and partly to the formation of crystalline silicates,
notably <i>Sillimanite</i> (<a href="#Bibl_13">13</a>).</p>

<p>The extent to which clays are ordinarily heated
and the conditions under which they are cooled do
not usually induce the formation of crystals; the
object of the clayworker being to produce a homogeneous
mass, the particles of which are securely
held together. The result is that burned clay products
are usually composed of amorphous particles
cemented by a glass-like material formed by the
fusion of some of the mineral ingredients of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
original substance. The silicates formed are, therefore,
in a condition of solid, super-cooled solution in
which the tendency to crystallize is restrained by
viscosity.</p>

<p>On raising the temperature of firing or on prolonging
the heating at the previous maximum temperature
the viscosity of the fused portion is diminished
and crystallization may then occur. The facility with
which crystallization occurs varies greatly with the
composition of the fused material, those silicates
which are rich in lime and magnesia crystallizing
more readily than those containing potash or soda.
Vogt has stated that small quantities of alumina
promote the formation of a glassy structure, and
Morozewicz has shown that a large excess of this
substance must be present if crystallization is to
occur.</p>

<p>The study of the reactions which occur when clays
are heated is, however, extremely complex, not only
on account of the variety of substances present, but
also on account of the high temperatures at which it
is necessary to work, so that for a further consideration
of it the reader should consult special treatises
on the fusion of silicates. This subject has now
become an important branch of physical chemistry.</p>

<p class="caption3">CLAY AND ASSOCIATED ROCKS</p>


<p>Clay, as already mentioned, is geologically a rock
and not a mineral, and belongs to the important
group of sedimentary rocks which have been derived
from the igneous or primary ones by processes of
weathering, suspension in water and subsequent
deposition or sedimentation.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the primary origin of clay, its
chief occurrence is in geological formations which
have undoubtedly been formed by aqueous action.
The materials resulting from the exposure of primary
rocks to the action of the elements have been carried
away by water&mdash;often for long distances&mdash;and after
undergoing various purifications have been deposited
where the speed of the water has been sufficiently
reduced.</p>

<p>In some cases they have again been transported
and re-deposited and not infrequently clay deposits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
are found which show signs of subsequent immersion
at considerable depths and have every appearance of
having been subjected to enormous pressures and
possibly to high temperatures.</p>

<p>Some clays have only been carried by small streams
and for short distances; these are seldom highly
plastic and resemble the lean china clays and kaolins.
Others have been carried by rapidly moving rivers
and have been discharged into lakes or into the
sea; they have thus undergone a process of gradual
purification by elutriation, the sand and other heavier
particles being first deposited and the far smaller
particles of clay being carried a greater distance
towards the centre of the lake or the quieter portions
of the ocean. The nature of such deposits will,
naturally, differ greatly from each other, the materials
at first associated with the clay, or becoming mixed
with it at a later stage, exercising an important
influence on its texture, composition and properties.
If the transporting stream flows through valleys whose
sides are formed of limestone, chalk, sandstone or
other materials, these will become mixed with the
clay, and to so great an extent has the mixing
occurred that very few clays occur in a state even
approximating to purity. The majority of clays are
contaminated with iron oxide, lime compounds and
free silica in such a fine state of division that it
is impossible to purify them completely without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
destroying the nature of the clay. In addition to this
it must be remembered that the land is continually
rising or sinking owing to internal changes in the
interior of the earth, and that these subterranean
changes bring about tilting, folding, overturning and
other secondary changes, which, later, cause a fresh
set of materials to be mixed with the clays. Further
than this, the action of the weather, of rivers and of
the sea never ceases, so that a process of re-mixing
and re-sorting of materials is continuously taking
place, and has been doing so for countless ages. It
is, therefore, a legitimate cause for wonder that such
enormous deposits of clays of so uniform a character
should occur throughout the length and breadth of
Europe, and practically throughout the world. For
although the composition of many of these beds is of
a most highly complex nature, the general properties
such as plasticity, behaviour on heating, etc., remain
remarkably constant over large areas of country, and
the clays of each geological formation are so much
alike in different parts of the world as to be readily
recognized by anyone familiar with the material of
the same formations in this country. Considerable
differences undoubtedly exist, but these are insignificant
in comparison with the vastly different circumstances
under which the deposits were accumulated.</p>

<p>Leaving the consideration of the modes of formation
of the various clay deposits to later chapters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
(<a href="#CHAPTER_III"><span class="smcap">III</span></a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_IV"><span class="smcap">IV</span></a>), it is convenient here to enumerate some
of the chief characteristics of the different clay
deposits and their associated rocks. In this connection
it is not proposed to enter into minute details,
but rather to indicate in broad outline the chief
characteristics of the clays from the different deposits.
This general view is the more necessary as clay occurs
in each main geological division of the sedimentary
rocks and in almost every sub-division in various parts
of the world.</p>

<p>The <b>Precambrian, Cambrian, Silurian and
Devonian</b> 'clays' are chiefly in the form of shales or
slates, the latter being clays which have undergone a
metamorphic change; the latter resulted in the production
of a hard and partially crystalline material
with but little potential plasticity and therefore of
small importance for the ordinary purposes of clay
working.</p>

<p><i>Slates</i> are distinguished from shales by their
splitting into thin leaves which are not in the
plane of original deposition, but are due to the
deposited material being subjected to great lateral
pressure. The re-arrangement of the particles thus
produced has imparted to the material a cleavage
quite independent of the original lamination.</p>

<p>The shales in these formations are occasionally
soft and friable and are then termed <i>marls</i>, but this
name is misleading as they contain no appreciable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
proportion of finely divided calcium carbonate as do
the true marls<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Readers desiring more detailed information on the occurrence of
the clays mentioned in this chapter should refer to the author's
<i>British Clays</i> (<a href="#Bibl_2">No. 2</a> in Bibliography).</p></div>

<p>The clays in the <b>Carboniferous Limestone</b> are
not, as a whole, of much importance, but the
occurrence in this formation of pockets of white
refractory clays in Staffordshire, North Wales (Mold)
and Derbyshire is interesting, especially as these are
used for the manufacture of firebricks and furnace
linings. These clays are highly silicious and in composition
are intermediate between the Yorkshire
fireclays and ganister. Their origin is uncertain,
but it is generally considered that they have been
produced by the action of the weather and streams
on the shales and grits of the Coal Measures which
formerly occupied the higher ground around them,
though Maw (<a href="#Bibl_16">16</a>) states that 'it is scarcely open
to question that they are the remnants of the subaerial
dissolution of the limestone' (see 'Fireclays,'
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter <span class="smcap">V</span></a>).</p>

<p>In the <b>Upper Carboniferous System</b> the clays
are highly important because of their general refractory
nature, though they differ greatly in this
respect, some red-burning shales of this formation
having no greater power to resist heat than have
some of the surface clays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Those of the Coal Measures are of two main
kinds&mdash;shales, or laminated rocks which readily split
along the planes of deposition, and unstratified underclays.
The <i>shales</i> usually occur above the seams of
coal and are either of lacustrine or marine origin,
differences in their fossils and lithological character
supporting one origin for some deposits and the other
for the remainder. Some of them are fairly uniform
in composition, but others vary so greatly in their
physical characters, that they are divided by miners
into 'binds' or relatively pure shales, 'rock-binds,'
or sandy shales, and sandstones. They also vary
greatly in thickness in different localities, and whilst
they form the main feature in some districts, in
others they are replaced by sandstones.</p>

<p>The <i>underclays</i> are so called from their usually
lying beneath the coal seams. They are not noticeably
stratified and vary greatly in character from soft unctuous
materials to hard, sandy rocks. In composition
they vary enormously, the percentage of silica ranging
from 50 per cent., or less, to as high as 97 per cent.</p>

<p>The mode of formation of the underclays is not
certainly known. They do not appear to be soils or
of terrestrial origin, but according to Arber (<a href="#Bibl_24">24</a>)
correspond closely to the black oozes of marine and
semi-marine estuarine deposits of tropical swamps,
or to the muds surrounding the stumps of trees in
the buried forests of our coast-lines. They thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
appear to be quite distinct from the shales above
them, both in origin and physical characters. The
more silicious portions, known as <i>Ganister</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, possess
comparatively few of the characteristics of clay
though used, like all the more refractory clays of the
Coal Measures, for all purposes for which fireclay is
employed. The term <i>fireclay</i> is, in fact, frequently
applied to all the refractory deposits in the Coal
Measures, without much regard to their composition
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter <span class="smcap">V</span></a>).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The Dinas rock used in the Vale of Neath (Wales) is an even
more silicious material found in the Millstone Grit immediately
below the Coal Measures. It is largely employed for firebricks.</p></div>

<p>Valuable Coal Measure clays occur in enormous
quantities in Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire,
Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, near
Stourbridge, in Warwickshire, Shropshire, North and
South Wales and South West Scotland. In Ireland,
on the contrary, the Coal Measure clays are of little
value except in the neighbourhood of Coal Island, co.
Tyrone. The position of the 'Sagger Marls' of North
Staffordshire (Keele Series and Etruria Marls), relative
to the 'Farewell Rock' or Millstone Grit, is shown
in <a href="#Fig_8">fig. 8</a> in which the horizontal lines represent
coal-seams and ironstone veins.</p>

<p>The dissimilarities in the fossils of the Coal
Measure clays and shales in the Northern and
Southern Hemispheres suggest that there is a
considerable difference in their formation, but the
number of clays and shales which have been
examined is too small for any accurate conclusion
to be drawn.</p>

<p>For many industrial purposes, particularly for the
manufacture of refractory goods, the clays and shales
of the Carboniferous System are highly important.
The less valuable burn to a reddish colour, often
spoiled with many grey spots of ferrous silicate derived
from the pyrites in the clay, but the purer varieties
burn to a delicate primrose or pale buff tint and are
amongst the most heat-resisting materials known.
The Coal Measure clays of Yorkshire are particularly
esteemed for their refractory properties; for the
manufacture of glazed bricks and for blocks for
architectural purposes somewhat ambiguously termed
'glazed terra-cotta.' The inferior qualities are
largely used for the manufacture of red engineering
bricks, some of them competing successfully with the
more widely known 'blue bricks' of Staffordshire.</p>

<p>The Coal Measure clays of Shropshire are noted
for the manufacture of red roofing tiles, especially in
the neighbourhood of Broseley.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, the Coal Measure clays are usually
poor, but are occasionally of good quality. The shales
produce heavy, cold clays and the yellow subsoil
produces soils of a light, hungry character so that the
two should, if possible, be mixed together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Permian clays</b> are of little value except for the
manufacture of red building bricks. The Nottinghamshire
Permian clays make excellent roofing tiles,
flower pots and red bricks.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, the Permian clays are a free working
loam yielding large crops of most of the ordinary
farm products.</p>

<p><b>Triassic clays</b> are of great importance in the
Midlands, those upper portions of them known as the
Keuper Marls being much used for the manufacture
of bricks.</p>

<p>They are specially known amongst clayworkers as
the material from which the Midland red bricks of
Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire and the Somersetshire
tiles are prepared.</p>

<p><b>Jurassic clays</b> are an important group, of marine
origin, occurring in close association with limestone.
For this reason they form a valuable source of material
for the manufacture of Portland cement, but are of
less value to the brick and tile manufacturer. The
Jurassic System contains so large a variety of clays,
of such widely different ages and characteristics, that
no general description of them can be given in the
present volume.</p>

</div>

<p>The '<i>Lias clays</i>'&mdash;the lowest of the Jurassic formation&mdash;are
chiefly dark, bituminous shales, including
the 'alum shales,' and are often seriously contaminated
with pyrites and ironstone. When carefully selected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
they may be used to advantage in the production of
most red articles such as bricks, tiles, chimney pots,
etc. They shrink less in the kiln than do most clays,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and are easily fusible on account of the lime they
contain, but on the whole this formation is of great
value for the manufacture of the articles just mentioned.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, the Lias clays are laid down for
grass, but the lighter soils are useful for arable
purposes.</p>

<p>The '<i>Oolitic clays</i>,' which are also Jurassic, usually
contain limestone in the form of nodules, but are
nevertheless important. They form a broad belt
above the Lias from Dorset to Yorkshire, and include
the blue clays of the Purbeck beds, stiff blue bituminous
Kimeridge clays, the irregular, sandy Coral Rag clays,
the famous Oxford clay (from which the Peterborough
and Fletton bricks are made), the Kellaways blue
clay, and the Fuller's Earth deposits.</p>

<p>The '<i>Kimeridge clays</i>' are dark, stiff laminated
clays, closely resembling gault, and are much used in
the West and Midlands for brickmaking. A well-known
deposit of this character has long been used
at Pickering in Yorkshire, but the most typical
deposits are in Huntingdonshire. The Kimeridge
clays contain a bituminous shale, or Sapropelic Coal,
which evolves a characteristic odour on burning.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, the Kimeridge clays resemble
gault and are difficult to work as arable land, though
they form first-rate pasturage.</p>

<p>The '<i>Oxford clays</i>' are valuable for brickmaking
when their use is understood, but to the uninitiated
they are very troublesome. Their colour is dark blue
or grey and they are usually stiff or somewhat shaly
in texture with layers of variable composition. The
closely associated Cornbrash (limestone) is a source
of trouble unless great care is taken in the selection
of the material. 'Oxford clays' are not infrequently
traversed by seams of poor coal or by oil-shales.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, Oxford clay is difficult to work
and, while much of it is valuable, large portions are
poor and cold. When well exposed to frost it is made
much lighter, but even then is not very suitable for
wheat and autumn sown crops.</p>

<p>The '<i>Kellaway blue clays</i>' are often included in
the Oxford clays, though they form irregular bands
above them and are of fresh-water origin, whilst the
Oxford clays are marine deposits. They are chiefly
used commercially for domestic firebricks near Oundle
and Stamford.</p>

<p><b>Cretaceous clays</b> occur, as their name implies, in
association with chalk. The chief clay in this System
is the <i>gault</i>, a stiff, black, calcareous clay of marine
origin chiefly used for brickmaking. When used
alone, gault burns to a reddish colour, due to the
iron present, but if, as is more usual, it is mixed with
chalk, it burns perfectly white. Some gaults contain
sufficient chalk to render the addition of a further
quantity unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Agriculturally, the Cretaceous clays form good
arable soil where they are not too exposed, but they
suffer from drought.</p>

<p>The '<i>Wealden clay</i>' is a stiff yellowish grey or
blue clay extensively used for brickmaking in Kent,
Sussex and Surrey. It has been subdivided by
geologists into a number of other clays, such as the
Wadhurst, Fairlight, etc., but the differences between
them lie more in the fossils occurring in them than
in the characters of the clays themselves. They are
usually contaminated with ironstone, gypsum and
some limestone.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, the Wealden clay produces stiff,
yellowish soils of a wet and poor character, but
sometimes loams of a highly productive nature occur.</p>

<p>The <b>Tertiary clays</b> include all those deposited
after the Chalk and previous to the close of the
Glacial period. They are usually mixed with sand
and gravel, and though the deposits are often thin
and irregular they are the most generally important
of all clays. They vary greatly in character; some,
like the London clay, being almost useless unless
mixed with other materials, whilst others like the
ball clays of Devonshire and Dorset are amongst the
purest and most valuable of the plastic clays. The
Tertiary clays are divided by geologists into Pliocene,
Miocene and Eocene formations; of these the first
are commercially unimportant and the second do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
exist in Great Britain. At one time the Bovey Tracey
clays were considered to be Miocene, but they have
recently been classed as Oligocene by Clement Reid.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, the most important of the Tertiary
formations is the Eocene, particularly near London,
though it is much covered by sand or gravel. The
<i>London clay</i>, which produces a heavy brown soil,
is of slight value, though when properly drained it
produces good crops of wheat, beans, and cabbages
and other market-garden produce. For this purpose
it is greatly improved by the addition of lime and of
town manure. The South Hampshire Eocene beds
of clay are cold, wet and of small agricultural value.</p>

<p>The Eocene clays are composed of a variety of clays,
many of which are only distinguishable by the different
fossils they contain. The most important are the
Reading clays, the London clay and the Bagshot clays.</p>

<p>The <i>Reading clays</i> extend over a considerable
area in the South of England and are most valuable
near the town from which they derive their name.
The best qualities are mottled in a characteristic
manner and are particularly suitable for the manufacture
of roofing tiles and small terra-cotta&mdash;an
industry for which Reading is famous.</p>

<p>The <i>London clay</i> is always a treacherous material
and is best avoided in the manufacture of bricks and
other articles except under highly skilled technical
advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Bagshot clays</i> in Dorsetshire are famous for
the ball and pipe clays shipped from Poole, whilst at
Bovey Tracey and in several parts of Devonshire
equally valuable ball clays are found and are shipped
from Teignmouth.</p>

<p>These <i>ball clays</i> are of variable composition and
colour and require careful selection and testing. They
are closely associated with sands, but the lower beds
of clay are remarkably stiff, plastic and white-burning.
The colour of the raw clay varies from a pale yellow
to a dark brown or even to black, but this is little or
no criterion of the colour of goods made therefrom, as
the colour is due to carbonaceous matters, 4 per cent.
or more carbon being usually present.</p>

<p>The 'blue' and 'black' ball clays are the most valued
by potters, but the quality is usually ascertained by
a burning test.</p>

<p>The value of these ball clays both in Devonshire
and Dorset is due to their comparative freedom from
iron and alkalies and to their remarkable unctuousness
and plasticity. They are, therefore, largely used
in the manufacture of all kinds of earthenware of
which they form the foundation material.</p>

<p>In composition, ball clays appear to consist chiefly
of a hydro-alumino-silicate corresponding to the
formula H<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, and in this they very closely
resemble the china clays (kaolins). The latter are,
however, but slightly plastic whilst the ball clays are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
amongst the most plastic clays known. The china
clays are also much more refractory than the ball
clays owing to the somewhat larger proportion of
alkalies in the latter.</p>

<p><i>Pipe clays</i> are an inferior quality of ball clay; they
contain rather more iron and alkalies and considerably
more silica. For this reason they can only be used for
cheaper wares where colour is of less importance and
where their excessive contraction can be neutralized
by the addition of other substances such as flint.</p>

<p>The <b>Boulder clays</b> occur in a blanket-like covering
of Drift which lies over the greater part of Northern
and Central England, and over a considerable portion
of Scotland and Ireland. They are a product of the
Ice Age and, whilst varying greatly in character, may
usually be distinguished by the occurrence in them
of rounded stones and gravel, some of the former
bearing clear indications of glacial action. The boulder
clays are largely used for the manufacture of building
bricks, but the strata in which they occur are so
irregular that very careful supervision of the digging
is necessary. In some localities these clays form
beds 12 ft. or more in thickness and relatively free
from gravel; in other districts the clay is interspersed
with lenticular deposits of gravel or sand (commonly
known as 'pockets'), and if these are mixed with the
clay considerable difficulty in manufacture may be
experienced. The total thickness of the drift deposits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is often very great, as in the cliffs at Filey (<a href="#Fig_11">fig. 11</a>)
which are 200 ft. high.</p>

<div class="fig_center">

<p class="fig_caption">Fig. 11. Cliffs of Boulder clay at Filey lying on Calcareous Crag.</p>
</div>

<p>The boulder clays&mdash;considered apart from the
stones, gravel and sandy materials occurring with
them&mdash;are usually red-burning, stiff and very plastic,
but the gravel, sand and crushed stones mixed with
them in the formation of the material usually
render them of medium plasticity. By careful washing,
most boulder clays may be purified sufficiently
to enable coarse brown pottery to be made from
them. Clean deposits of sufficient size to be worked
without any purification are occasionally found.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Usually, however, the boulder clay formation is somewhat
treacherous as it is difficult to ascertain its
nature; boreholes are apt to be quite misleading as
the formation is so irregular in character.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, drift or boulder clays are poor soils,
but by judicious management and careful mixing
they may be made more fertile. Where it contains
chalk&mdash;as in Norfolk and Suffolk&mdash;boulder drift forms
an excellent arable soil.</p>

<p><b>Pleistocene or Recent clays</b> are amongst the
most important brickmaking materials in the South
of England. They are of remarkably varied character,
having been derived from a number of other
formations. Usually the deposits are somewhat
shallow and irregular in form, but beds of considerable
thickness occur in some localities.</p>

<p>Agriculturally, they are of considerable importance.</p>

<p>Most of the <b>brick earths</b> used in the south-east
of England are of Recent formation, those of the
Thames Valley being of special importance in this
connection, particularly where they are associated
with chalk; thus forming natural <i>marls</i> or enabling
artificial marls to be produced.</p>

<p>The brick earths&mdash;in the sense in which this
term is used in the south&mdash;comprise three important
types of clay: (<i>a</i>) <i>Plastic clays</i> not particularly
differentiated from those already described, (<i>b</i>) <i>Loams</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
or sandy clays which are sufficiently plastic for
satisfactory use, have the advantage of shrinking but
slightly in drying, and are largely used in the manufacture
of red facing bricks and as light soils, and
(<i>c</i>) <i>Marls</i> or calcareous clays, used for the production
of light coloured or white bricks, the chalk they
contain combining with any iron compounds present
and, at the same time, reducing the contractility of
the clay. On burning, they form a cement which
binds the particles into a strong mass. These are
the 'true marls' or 'malms' composed of clay and
chalk and must not be confused with the so-called
marls of Staffordshire and elsewhere which are almost
free from lime compounds. There is, at present, no
definition of 'marl' which is quite satisfactory; a
maker of London stock bricks understanding by this
term a clay containing at least 10 per cent. of chalk;
a maker of white Suffolk bricks a material containing
at least twice this amount; an agriculturalist any
soil, not obviously sandy, which will make his clay
land less sticky; and many geologists any friable
argillaceous earths. A general consensus of opinion
is, however, being gradually reached that the term
'marl' should be limited, as far as possible, to clays
containing calcium carbonate in a finely divided
state.</p>

<p><b>Alluvial deposits</b>&mdash;which are also of Recent
formation, though still of sufficient age for skeletons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of mammoths to be found in them&mdash;are of so variable
a nature as to render any brief, general description
impossible. Many of them are so contaminated with
sand and crushed limestone as to be useless for
manufacturing purposes and of small value agriculturally,
but others are important in both these
respects.</p>

<p>Further details of the occurrence of clays in the
various formations described will be found in the
<i>Maps and Memoirs of the Geological Survey</i> and in
the author's <i>British Clays</i> (<a href="#Bibl_2">2</a>).</p>

<p class="caption3">THE ORIGINS OF CLAYS</p>


<p>The terms 'primary' and 'residual' are applied
to those clays which are found overlying or in close
association with the rocks from which they have been
derived, and distinguish them from the 'secondary'
or 'transported' clays which have been carried some
distance away from their place of origin.</p>

<p><b>Residual clays</b> may be formed by the simple
removal of other materials, the clay remaining behind,
as in the decomposition of some argillaceous limestones,
in which the calcareous matter has been
removed by solution whilst the clay is unaffected.
Such a clay is not a primary one as it has probably
been derived from some distant source and, having
been deposited along with the limestone ooze, has
formed an intimate mixture from which the limestone
has, at a later geological epoch, been removed in the
manner indicated. Residual clays are seldom pure,
being often rich in iron compounds, though the
white clays of Staffordshire and Derbyshire are
highly refractory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>It is seldom necessary to distinguish residual
clays from other secondary or transported ones
(Chapters <span class="smcap">II</span> and <span class="smcap">IV</span>).</p>

<p><b>Primary clays</b>, on the contrary, have been derived
from rocks which have undergone chemical
decomposition, one of the products being clay. The
most important primary clays are the kaolins, which
are derived from the decomposition of felspar, but
other primary clays derived from other minerals are
known, though less frequently mentioned.</p>

<p>The <i>kaolins</i> are primary clays<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> formed by the
decomposition of felspar and occur in many parts of
the world. In Great Britain the most important are
the china clays found in Devon and Cornwall, which
occur in association with the granite from which
they have been formed. The kaolins in Germany
are, apparently, of similar origin, though some are
derived from porphyry and not from granite; they
are the chief material used in the manufacture
of Dresden, Meissen, Berlin and other porcelains.
The French kaolins from St Yrieux and Limousin
are said by Granger (<a href="#Bibl_17">17</a>) to be derived from gneiss
amphibole. The American kaolins have, according
to Ries (<a href="#Bibl_6">6</a>), been chiefly formed from the weathering
of pegmatite veins, but the origin of some important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
deposits in Texas and Indiana has not yet been fully
explained.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Some kaolins
in central Europe appear to have been transported
and of secondary origin.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The corresponding material used by the Chinese
for the manufacture of porcelain bears a name which
is really that of the place from whence it was originally
obtained; the term <i>Kao-ling</i> indicates merely
a high ridge. According to Richthofen (<a href="#Bibl_18">18</a>) the rock
from which Chinese porcelain is made is not a true
kaolin, but is allied to the <i>jades</i>. The term 'kaolin'
is therefore a misnomer when applied to white-burning,
primary clays generally, but its use has
become so firmly established as to render it permanent.</p>

<p>Kaolins are seldom found in a sufficiently pure
state to be used direct, but must be freed from large
amounts of undecomposed rock, quartz, mica, etc., by
a process of washing and sedimentation. When
purified in this manner, the best qualities of china
clay yield, on analysis, alumina, silica and water in
the proportions indicated by the formula H<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>
together with about 5 per cent. of mica and other
impurities. Some high class commercial kaolins
contain over 30 per cent. of mica and 10 per cent.
of quartz.</p>

<p>The chief constituents of rocks which take part in
the production of kaolins appear to be the felspars,
but the natural processes by which these felspars
are decomposed are by no means perfectly understood.
Some kaolins appear to have been formed by
weathering and others by subaerial action. Thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Collins (<a href="#Bibl_19">19</a>) has stated very emphatically that the
kaolinization of Cornish felspar has been chiefly
effected by fluorine and other substances rising from
below and not by carbonic acid and water acting from
above. Ries (<a href="#Bibl_6">6</a>) and other American observers are
equally convinced that certain kaolins they have
examined are the result of 'weathering.' German and
French investigators are divided in their opinions,
and Fuchs has found that the Passau (Saxony) kaolin
is derived from a special mineral, not unlike a soda-lime
felspar deficient in silica, to which he has given
the name 'porcelain spar.'</p>

<p>The <i>felspars</i> form a class of minerals whose chief
characteristic is the combination of an alkaline or
alkaline-earth base with silica and alumina. Orthoclase
(K<sub>2</sub>O Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 6SiO<sub>2</sub>)&mdash;the chief potassium felspar&mdash;is
typical of the whole class. When treated with
water under suitable conditions, the felspar appears
to become hydrolysed and some of the water enters
into combination, the potash being removed by
solution. Attempts to effect this decomposition
artificially have proved abortive though several investigators
appear to have effected it to a limited
extent by electrolysis or by heating under great
pressure (<a href="#Bibl_3">3</a>).</p>

<p>The effect on felspars of waters containing carbon
dioxide in solution has been studied by Forschammer,
Vogt, and others, and they have concluded that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
kaolinization may occur with this agent though it
does not appear to be the chief cause in the formation
of Cornish china clays.</p>

<i>by permission of Macmillan &amp; Co.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The probable effect of fluoric vapours has been
studied by Collins (<a href="#Bibl_19">19</a>) who confirmed von Buch's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
observation that fluorides (particularly lepidolite
and tourmaline) are constantly associated with china
clay; he found by direct experiment that felspar
is decomposed by hydrofluoric acid at the ordinary
temperature without the other constituents of the
granite in which it occurs being affected. This
theory is confirmed by the great depths of the kaolin
deposits in Cornwall and in Zettlitz (Bohemia) which
appear to be too great to render satisfactory any
theory of simple weathering though kaolins in
other localities, especially in America, appear to
be largely the result of weathering. According to
Hickling (<a href="#Bibl_36">36</a>) the product of the action of hydrofluoric
acid 'has not the remotest resemblance to
china clay.'</p>

<p>Kaolin, when carefully freed from its impurities,
as far as this is possible, is peculiarly resistant to the
action of water. This resistance may be due to its
highly complex constitution, as the simpler hydro-alumino-silicates,
such as collyrite, show an acid
reaction when ground with water. Rohland (<a href="#Bibl_5">5</a>),
therefore, suggests that kaolinization is effected by
water first hydrolysing the felspar and forming
colloidal silica and sodium or potassium hydroxides
which are removed whilst the complex alumino-silicate
remains in the form of kaolin. Hickling (<a href="#Bibl_36">36</a>),
on the contrary, believes that the action of the
weather on felspar produces secondary muscovite&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
form of mica&mdash;and that this is, later, converted into
kaolinite or china clay (<a href="#Fig_17">fig. 17, p. 105</a>).</p>

<p>The various theories which have been propounded
may be summarized into three main classes, and
whilst it is probable that any one of them, or any one
combination, may be true for a particular kaolin, yet
the whole process of kaolinization is so complex and
the conditions under which it has occurred appear to
be so diverse that it is doubtful if any simple theory
can be devised which will satisfactorily meet all
cases.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The decomposition of the granite, and particularly
of the felspar within it, may be ascribed to
purely chemical reactions in which the chief agents
are water and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Other substances&mdash;possibly of an organic
nature and derived from the soil&mdash;may have played
an important part.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Wet steam and hot solutions of fluorine,
boron or sulphur compounds may have effected the
decomposition.</p>

<p>The recent progress made in the application of the
laws of physical chemistry to geological problems is
continually throwing fresh light on this interesting
subject. Thus, studies of the dissociation pressures
and transition points between the anhydrous and the
hydrous states of various substances and the effect
of water as a powerful agent of decomposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
(hydrolysis) have shown that hydration is a characteristic
result of decompositions occurring in the upper
portions of the earth's crust and not in the lower ones,
and that it is usually checked, or even reversed, when
the substance is under great pressure. At great
depths kaolins and other complex hydrous silicates
give place to anhydrous ones such as muscovite,
andalusite and staurolite. There is, therefore, good
reason to believe that the kaolinization of Cornish
felspar has occurred at only moderate depths from the
surface and that it has been chiefly produced by the
action of water containing acid gases in solution.
The acid in the water may have been absorbed from
the atmosphere, or it may be due to vapours rising from
below through the felspathic material.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, china clay occurs in the form of
powdery particles apparently amorphous, but containing
some crystals, scattered through a mass of
harder rock, the whole being known as china clay
rock or 'carclazite.' The softer portions of this
china clay rock are known as 'growan' and the china
clay in it represents only a small proportion of the
whole material.</p>

<p>The finer particles of clay and other materials are
removed by treatment with water, whereby one-third
to one-eighth of the material is separated. This
small proportion is then subjected to further washing
and sedimentation in order to obtain the china clay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in a state of commercial purity. It will thus be
understood that the Cornish china clays are not
'deposits' in the usual acceptation of that term, the
soft growan from which they are obtained being
almost invariably the result of decomposition <i>in situ</i>
of some species of felspar in disintegrated granite.</p>

<p>The commercial kaolins of France, Germany,
America and China very closely resemble the Cornish
china clays in composition, but when used in the
manufacture of porcelain they create differences in
the finished material which are clearly noticeable,
though microscopical examination and chemical
analysis, at present, fail to distinguish between them
in the raw state on account of their great resistance
to ordinary chemical and physical forces.</p>

<p>In addition to the breaking up of felspathic rocks
with the formation of china clay or kaolin (kaolinization),
other decompositions which occur may result
in the formation of clays, and an examination of a
considerable number of clays by J. M. van Bemmelen
(<a href="#Bibl_26">26</a>) has led him to suppose that several different clay-forming
forces have been at work in the production
of clays. He classifies these under four heads:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Kaolinization</i>, or the decomposition of
felspathic and similar rocks by the action of telluric
water containing active gases in solution.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Ordinary weathering</i> in which the action
is largely mechanical, but is accompanied by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hydrolysis owing to the impurities contained in the
water which is an essential factor.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Lateritic action</i>&mdash;or simple decomposition
by heat&mdash;which occurs chiefly under tropical conditions,
but may also occur in temperate climates,
and has for its main product a mixture of free
silica and alumina, the latter being in the form
of (amorphous) 'laterite.' It may not improbably be
a result of the decomposition of the clay molecule
similar to that which occurs when china clay is
heated, as there is no temperature below which it can
be said that china clay does not decompose into free
silica and alumina (<a href="#Bibl_29">29</a>).</p>

<p>(4) <i>Secondary reactions</i> in which the products
of one of the reactions previously described may
undergo further changes, as the conversion of
amorphous clayite into crystalline kaolinite, or
amorphous laterite into crystalline hydrargillite.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Weathering.</span></p>

<p>The action of the forces conveniently classed under
the term <i>weathering</i> are of two main kinds:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <i>mechanical grinding</i> of sandstone,
quartzite, limestone, and other rocks, causes an addition
of adventitious material to clay, the proportions
being sometimes so large as to render it necessary
to term the material an argillaceous sand, rather than

a sandy clay. Some of these grains of mineral matter
are so minute and so resistant to the ordinary chemical
reagents as to make it extremely difficult to distinguish
them from clay.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The <i>chemical decomposition</i> due to the action
of very dilute solutions. By this means simple
silicates are decomposed with the formation of colloidal
silica which may either remain in solution or may be
deposited in a coagulated form. At the same time,
some alumino-silicates will be similarly decomposed
into colloidal alumino-silicic acids or clays.</p>

<p>The ultimate results of the action of ordinary
weathering on silicate rocks are, therefore, sands and
clays, the latter being in some ways quite distinct in
their origin and physical properties from the china
clays. According to J. M. van Bemmelen (<a href="#Bibl_26">26</a>) such
clays also contain an alumino-silicate soluble in boiling
hydrochloric acid followed by caustic soda, whereas
pure china clays are unaffected by this treatment.</p>

<p>The variety of silicates and other minerals which&mdash;in
a partially decomposed condition&mdash;go to form
'clays' is so great that the complete separation of
the smallest particles of them from those of the
true clay present has never been accomplished and
our knowledge of the mineralogical constitution of
many of the best known clays is far from complete.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that the action of water does
not cease with the formation of clay, but that it slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
effects an increase in the plasticity of the clay. There
thus appear to be at least three kinds of primary
clay, viz.:</p>

<p><i>Kaolinic</i> or <i>china clays</i> which are chiefly derived
from felspar and can be isolated in a relatively pure
state. They are highly refractory, but only slightly
plastic.</p>

<p><i>Epigenic</i> or <i>colloidal clays</i> derived from kaolinic
clays, as a secondary product, or directly from
felspar, mica, augite and other alumino-silicates by
'weathering.' They are usually less refractory and
much more plastic than the china clays and contain a
large percentage of impurities&mdash;sometimes in the
form of free silica (sand) or of metallic oxides,
carbonates, sulphides, sulphates, silicates, or other
compounds. Many so-called secondary clays such
as pipe clays, ball clays and fireclays may be of
this type, though their origin is difficult to trace
owing to their subsequent transportation and
deposition.</p>

<p><i>Lateritic</i> or <i>highly aluminous clays</i>, of a highly
refractory character, but low plasticity. They are
usually somewhat rich in iron oxide which materially
affects their plasticity. Unlike the china clays, pure
lateritic clays are completely decomposed by hydrochloric
acid. Bauxite and some of the highly aluminous
clays of the Coal Measures appear to be of this type.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these different types of clay are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
extremely difficult to distinguish and in many instances
they have become mixed with each other and with
other materials during the actions to be described in
the next chapter, that it is often almost impossible
to decide whether the true clay in a given specimen
possessed its characteristics <i>ab initio</i> or whether it
has gained them since the time when it ceased to be
a primary clay.</p>

<p><b>Secondary clays</b> are those which have been produced
by the action of the weather and other natural
forces on primary clays, the changes effected being
of a physical rather than a chemical nature (see
<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter <span class="smcap">IV</span></a>).</p>

<p>The essential constituent of secondary clays has
not been positively identified. In so far as it has
been isolated it differs from the true clay in the
primary clays in several important respects, and until
its nature has been more fully investigated great
caution must be exercised in assigning a definite
name to it. For many purposes the term <i>pelinite</i>
(<a href="#Page_149">p. 149</a>) is convenient, being analogous to the corresponding
one used for material in china clays
(<i>clayite</i>, <a href="#Page_107">p. 107</a>). These terms are purely provisional
and must be discarded when the true mineralogical
identities of the substances they represent have been
established.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE MODES OF ACCUMULATION OF CLAYS</p>


<p>From whatever sources clays may have been
originally derived, the manner in which they have
been accumulated in their present positions is a factor
of great importance both in regard to their chemical
and physical characters and their suitability for
various purposes.</p>

<p>As explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter <span class="smcap">III</span></a>, the china clays or
kaolins may usually be regarded as primary clays
derived from granitic or other felspathic or felsitic
rocks by chemical decomposition. Such clays are
found near to their place of origin, are usually
obtainable in a comparatively pure state and are
generally deficient in plasticity. They may occur in
beds of small or great depth, but these are not
'accumulations' in the ordinary meaning of that
term.</p>

<p>Residual clays (<a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a>) also form a distinct class,
as unlike the majority of argillaceous materials they
are left behind when other substances are removed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
usually by some process of solution. In many cases,
however, the residual clays are really secondary in
character, having been transported from their place
of origin, together with limestone or other minerals,
the mixture deposited and subjected to pressure and
possibly to heat, whereby a rock-like mass is formed.
This mass has then been subjected to the solvent
action of water containing carbon dioxide or other
substances which dissolve out the bulk of the
associated minerals and leave the residual clay
behind.</p>

<p>The chief agents in the transport and accumulation
of clays are the <i>air</i>, in the form of wind; <i>water</i>, in
the form of rain, streams, rivers, floods, lakes and
seas, or in the form of ice and snow as in glaciers
and avalanches; <i>earth-movements</i> such as the changes
wrought by volcanoes, earthquakes and the less clearly
marked rising and falling of various portions of the
earth's crust which result in folded, twisted, sheared,
cracked, inclined, laminated and other strata.</p>

<p>These agents have first moved the clay from its
original site and have later deposited it with other
materials in the form of strata of widely varying area
and thickness, some 'clay' beds being several hundred
feet in depth and occupying many square miles in
area, whilst others are in the form of thin 'veins'
only a few inches thick or in 'pockets' of small area
and depth. These deposits have in many places been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
displaced by subsequent earth-movements and have
been overlain by other deposits so as to render
them quite inaccessible. Others have been covered
by deposits several miles thick; but the greater part
of the covering has since been removed by glacial or
other forces, so that clays of practically all geological
ages may be found within the relatively small area of
Great Britain.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Transportation of Clays.</span></p>

<p>By the action of wind or rain, or of rain following
frost, the finer of particles clay are removed from
their primary site and as the rain drops collect into
streamlets, these unite to form streams and rivers
and the clay with its associated minerals is carried
along by the water. As it travels over other rocks
or through valleys composed of sandstone, limestone
and other materials, some of these substances are
dislodged, broken into fragments of various sizes and
with the clay are carried still further. In their
journey these materials rub against each other and
against the banks and bed of the stream, thereby
undergoing a prolonged process of grinding whereby
the softer rocks are reduced to very fine sand and
silt which becomes, in time, very intimately mixed
with the clay. If the velocity of the stream were
sufficiently great, the mixed materials&mdash;derived from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as many sources as there are rocks of the districts
through which they have passed&mdash;would be discharged
into a lake or into the sea. Here the velocity of the
water would be so greatly reduced that the materials
would gradually settle, the largest and heaviest
fragments being first deposited and the finer ones
at a greater distance.</p>

<p>With most streams and rivers, however, the
velocity of the water is very variable, and a certain
amount of deposition therefore occurs along the
course, the heavier particles only travelling a short
distance, whilst the finer ones are readily transported.
If the velocity of the stream increases, these finer
particles (which include the clay) may become mixed
with other particles of various sizes and the materials
thus undergo a series of mixings and partial sortings
until they are discharged at the river mouth or are
left along its sides by a gradual sinking of the water
level. The clay will be carried the whole course of
the river, unless it is deposited at some place where
the velocity of the water is reduced sufficiently to
permit it to settle.</p>

<p>If floods arise, the area affected by the water will
be increased. The <i>alluvial clays</i> have, apparently,
been formed by overflowing streams and rivers, the
material in suspension in the water being deposited
as the rate of flow diminished. Such alluvial deposits
contain a variety of minerals&mdash;usually in a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
finely divided state&mdash;clay, limestone-dust or chalk,
and sand being those most usually found.</p>

<p><i>River-deposited clays</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, those which have
accumulated along the banks, are characterized by
their irregularity in thickness, their variable composition
and the extent to which various materials
are mixed together. This renders them difficult to
work and greatly increases the risks of manufacture
as the whole character of a fluviatile clay may change
completely in the course of a few yards.</p>

<p>According to the districts traversed by the water,
the extent to which the materials have been deposited
and re-transported and the fresh materials introduced
by earth-movements, river-deposited clays may be
(<i>a</i>) <i>plastic</i> and sufficiently pure to be classified
as 'clays,' (<i>b</i>) <i>marls</i> or clays containing limestone-dust
or chalk thoroughly mixed with the clay, and
(<i>c</i>) <i>loams</i> or clays containing so much sand that they
may be distinguished by the touch from the clays in
class (<i>a</i>). Intermediate to these well-defined classes
there are numerous mixtures bearing compound
names such as sandy loams, sandy marls, argillaceous
limestone, calcareous sands, and calcareous arenaceous
clays, to which no definite characteristics can be
assigned.</p>

<p>To some extent a transportation of clays and
associated materials occurs in <i>lakes</i>, but the chief
processes there are of the nature of sedimentation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
accompanied by some amount of separation. On the
shores of lakes, and to a much larger extent on the
sea coasts, extensive erosion followed by transportation
occurs continuously, enormous quantities of
land being annually removed and deposited in some
portion of the ocean bed. The erosion of cliffs and
the corresponding formation of sand and pebbles
are too well known to need further description. It
should, however, be noticed that the clay particles,
being much finer, are carried so far away from the
shore that only pebbles and sand remain to form the
beaches, the finer particles forming 'ocean ooze.'</p>

<p>The action of the <i>sea</i> in the transport of rock-materials
is more intense than that of rivers, the
coasts being worn away by repeated blows from the
waves and the pebbles and sand grains the latter
contain. The ocean currents carry the materials
dislodged by the waves and transport them, sometimes
to enormous distances, usually allowing a
considerable amount of separation to take place
during the transit. In this way they act in a similar
manner to rivers and streams.</p>

<p><i>Glaciers</i> may be regarded as rivers of ice which
erode their banks and bed in a manner similar to,
but more rapidly than, streams of water. Owing to
their much greater viscosity, glaciers are able to
carry large boulders as well as gravel, sand and clay,
so that the materials transported by them are far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
more complex in composition and size than are those
carried by flowing water.</p>

<div class="fig_center">

</div>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Separation and Sedimentation.</span></p>

<p>The clay and other particles having been placed
in suspension in water by one or more of the natural
forces already mentioned, they soon undergo a process
of sorting or separation, previous to their deposition.
The power of water for carrying matter in suspension
depends largely on its velocity, and when this is
reduced, as when a river discharges into a lake or
sea, the larger and denser particles at once commence
to settle, the smaller ones remaining longer in
suspension, though if the velocity of the water is
reduced sufficiently all the particles will be deposited.
Hence, the deposits in lakes (<i>lacustrine</i>) and at the
mouths of rivers (<i>estuarine</i>) increase more or less
regularly in fineness according to their distance from
the point at which the water enters, the gravel and
stones being deposited first, then the coarse sand,
next the finer sand and finally the silt and clay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_14">fig. 14</a>). If cross-currents are present, the deposits
will, naturally, be made more irregular, and in some
cases variations in the flow of the transporting water
may cause the coarser particles to be carried further
than usual so that they may cover some of the finer
deposits previously formed; but as the clay and silt
particles are so much finer than sand and gravel they
usually travel so far before settling that their deposits
are very uniform if the area over which they are
spread is sufficiently large. Lake-deposited clays are
for this reason more uniform than estuarine beds,
whilst beds deposited at considerable depths in the
sea and at a great distance from land are still more
uniform.</p>

<p>A <i>lacustrine clay</i> is usually more persistent and
uniform than fluviatile beds though sometimes difficult
to distinguish from the latter. Some of the most
valuable clay deposits are of lacustrine formation;
their comparative purity and great uniformity enabling
ware of excellent colour and texture to be
produced without much difficulty. Thus the Reading
mottled clays of the Hampshire basin, on the outskirts
of the London basin and in Northern France
are well known for the admirable red bricks, tiles
and terra-cotta produced from them. Still purer
clays deposited at Bovey Heathfield in Devonshire
are also of lacustrine origin, though they differ in
many respects from the ordinary lake-deposited clays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and are of unusual thickness for deposits formed in
this manner.</p>

<p class="fig_caption">Fig. 15. Lacustrine clay at Skipsea. (<i>By courtesy of T. Sheppard Esq.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The greater purity of lacustrine clays, as compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
with fluviatile ones, is attributed to the much larger
area over which the deposit is spread,&mdash;enabling
variations in the deposits to be much less noticeable
than when a smaller area is covered&mdash;and to the very
small velocity of the water in lakes, whereby all the
coarser particles are deposited a considerable distance
away from the clays and silts.</p>

<p>Ries (<a href="#Bibl_6">6</a>) has pointed out that many (American)
lake-clays are of glacial origin, having been laid in
basins or hollows along the margin of the ice-sheet
or in valleys which have been dammed by an accumulation
of drift across them. Such clay beds are
usually surface deposits of variable thickness and
frequently impure. Like all lacustrine deposits they
show (though in a more marked degree than in the
older and larger lakes) alternate layers of sand and
clay, though the former are usually too thin to be
noticeable except for their action in enabling the
deposited material to be easily split along the lines
of bedding.</p>

<p><i>Estuarine deposits</i> partake of the nature of both
fluviatile and marine beds, according to their position
relative to the river from which they originate.
They are usually uncertain in character and are often
irregular in composition owing to the variations in
the flow of the water. The Estuarine clays of Great
Britain&mdash;with the possible exception of the Jurassic
deposits in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire&mdash;are
of minor importance, but in some countries they
form a valuable source of clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Marine clays</i> are, as their name implies, those
deposited from sea water. They are frequently found
at a considerable distance from the shores of the ocean
in which they were laid down, and subsequent risings
and fallings of the surface of the earth have so
altered the areas occupied by sea water, that a large
number of marine deposits now form dry land.
Though usually of enormous size and of generally
persistent character, marine clay deposits vary considerably
in the composition of the material at
different depths, as well as in different areas. This
is only to be expected from the manner of their
deposition, from the varied sources of the material
and from the numerous river- and ocean-currents
taking part in their formation. For this reason it
is generally necessary to mix together portions of
the deposit drawn from various depths in order to
secure a greater uniformity than would be obtained
if a larger area were to be worked to a smaller depth.</p>

<p>The Oxford clay which extends from the centre of
England to the centre of France is a typical marine
clay.</p>

<p>At the bottom of all oceans at the present day is
a deposit, of unknown thickness, of red calcareous
clay or <i>ooze</i> which is steadily increasing in amount
and is thereby forming a fresh marine deposit, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
at present its inaccessibility deprives it of all economic
value.</p>

<p>It is important not to overlook the enormous part
played by variations in the level of the land relative
to that of the ocean in past ages. For instance, there
is abundant evidence to show that practically the
whole of Great Britain has been repeatedly submerged
to great depths and has been raised to heights far
greater than its present average. These oft-repeated
risings and settlings have caused great changes in
the nature of the deposited materials so that in the
Coal Measures, for example, there are deposits of
obviously fresh-water origin sandwiched in between
others undoubtedly marine. It can readily be understood,
as stated by Arber (<a href="#Bibl_24">24</a>), that if, at a given
period, the dry land during the formation of the Coal
Measures gradually subsided, it would first be covered
with clear water, whilst from those portions of the
area which occupied the higher ground the rivers
and streams continued to pour into their estuary
a large amount of fresh-water material. Later, a
stage would be reached when mud of marine origin
invaded the area and covered the previous deposits.
When, after an indefinitely long period, the ground
again rose, fresh-water deposits might again form,
and this alternation of marine and fluviatile deposits
appears to have been repeated with great frequency
during the Carboniferous period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Lower Coal Measures of Yorkshire and
Lancashire, Stopes and Watson (<a href="#Bibl_23">23</a>) have shown that
the shales forming the roof of the Upper Foot Coal
were derived from drifted sediments of marine origin.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Precipitated Clays.</span></p>

<p>If the plasticity of some clays is really due to the
colloidal nature of their particles, it is obvious that
they must have been formed by a process of coagulation
or precipitation at a distance from the site
of the minerals from which they have been derived.
According to the 'colloid theory,' felspar and other
alumino-silicates are decomposed by 'weathering,' the
chief effect of which is the formation (by hydrolysis)
of a colloidal solution of 'clay.' This apparently clear
solution flows along in the form of a small streamlet,
joins other streamlets and continues its journey. So
long as it is quite neutral or contains free alkali the
solution will remain practically clear, but as soon as
acids enter the stream, or are formed in it by the
decomposition of organic matter, a coagulation of the
colloidal matter will commence and the amount of
'clay' thus thrown out of solution will depend on
the amount of such free acid.</p>

<p>If the coagulation or precipitation occurs in still
water, the 'clay' will be deposited almost immediately,
otherwise it will be carried forward until it reaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a place where it can be deposited in the manner
already described.</p>

<p>Such precipitated clays need not necessarily be
pure, as other substances may be present in colloidal
form and may be coagulated at the same time as the
clay. In addition to these, the admixture of sand and
other minerals present in suspension in the solution
may become mixed with the particles during coagulation
and be deposited with them.</p>

<p>Clays formed in this manner are extremely difficult
to identify on account of the highly complex nature
of the reactions occurring in their vicinity both during
and subsequent to their formation.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Re-Deposited Clays.</span></p>

<p>Although many clays and other materials have
been transported and accumulated in the manner
described, the majority of those now available have
been subjected to repeated transportation and deposition,
owing to the frequent and enormous changes
in the relative levels of land and water during the
various geological epochs. So far as can be ascertained,
it is during these changes of position and the recurrent
exposure to air and to water containing various substances
in solution, together with the almost incessant
grinding which took place during the transportation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and deposition, that most secondary clays became
plastic. If this is the case, it explains the impossibility
of increasing the plasticity of clay by artificial means,
at any rate on a large scale.</p>

<p>The simplest of the agents of re-deposition are
rain-storms and floods which, forming suddenly, may
cause the water of a stream or river to flow with
unwonted velocity and so carry away previously
formed deposits of various kinds. Clays transported
in this way are termed by Ries (<a href="#Bibl_6">6</a>) <i>colluvial</i> clays, the
term 'diluvial' is generally employed in this country.
If these are derived from a primary clay which has
not travelled far since it left the original granite from
which it was formed, they will usually be white-burning
and of only slight plasticity, but if the flood
affects materials which have already been re-deposited
several times, the colluvial clays may be of almost
any imaginable composition. Floods of a different
character&mdash;due to the subsidence of the land so that
it is partially covered with lake- or sea-water, which
beats on its shores and erodes it in the manner
already described&mdash;are also important factors in the
transportation of clays.</p>

<p>So far as clays are concerned, the action of the
sea is both erosive and depository, though the sedimentation
in it being that of the pelagic ooze at
great depths the clayey material is quite inaccessible.
Under certain conditions, however, the sea may erode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
land in one area and may return the transported
material to the land in another area. The diluvial
clay-silt known as <i>warp</i> in the valley of the Humber
is of this character.</p>

<p>Quite apart from the action of water, however,
much denudation, transportation and re-deposition
of clays and associated materials has been due to the
action of ice in the form of glaciers, though these do
not appear to have had much effect in increasing the
plasticity of the clays concerned.</p>

<p><i>Glacially deposited clays</i> are characterised by
their heterogeneous composition, some of them containing
far more sand than true clay, whilst yet
retaining a sufficient amount of plasticity to enable
them to be used for rendering embankments impervious
and for the manufacture of common bricks,
and, occasionally, of coarse pottery; others contain
so much sand as to be useless for these purposes.
Most glacial deposits contain a considerable proportion
of stones and gravel which must be removed
before the clay can be used.</p>

<p>The large proportion of adventitious matter is
due in great part to the much greater erosive force
and carrying power of ice as compared with water,
resulting in much larger pieces of material being
carried, and as the whole of the ice-borne material
is deposited almost simultaneously when the glacier
melts, only a very small amount of separation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
material into different grades takes place. The comparative
freedom from coarse sand of some glacial
clays shows that some sorting does occur, but it is
very limited in extent as compared with that wrought
in materials which have been exclusively transported
by water.</p>

<p>For the manufacture of bricks, tiles and coarse
pottery in Yorkshire, Lancashire and some of the
more northern counties of Great Britain, glacially
deposited clays are of great importance in spite of
their irregular composition. They are frequently
termed 'boulder clays' or 'drift clays' (<a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>), but in
using these or any other terms for clays transported
by glacial action it is important that they should not
be understood to refer to the whole of the deposited
matter. Large 'pockets' of coarse sand and gravel
frequently occur in deposits of this character and
veins of the same materials are by no means uncommon.
The custom of some geologists of referring
to the <i>whole</i> of a glacial deposit as 'boulder clay'
has, in a number of cases, led to serious financial loss
to clayworkers who have erroneously assumed that,
because some 'boulder clays' are used for brick and
tile manufacture, all deposits bearing a similar title
would be equally suitable. This difficulty would
largely be avoided if, as is now increasingly the case,
the term 'drift' or 'glacial deposit' were used for the
deposits as a whole, the term 'boulder clay' being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
restricted to the plastic portions and not including
pockets of sand, gravel and other non-plastic
materials.</p>

<p><i>Boulder clays</i>&mdash;using this term in the limited
sense just mentioned&mdash;consist of variable quantities
of sand and clay, stones and gravel being generally
associated with them. The stones may usually be
removed by careful picking, and the gravel by means
of a 'clay cleaner' which forces the plastic material
through apertures too small to allow the gravel to
pass. The plastic material so separated is far from
being a pure clay and may contain almost half its
weight of sand, the greater part of which is readily
separated by washing the material.</p>

<p>Boulder clays, when freed from stones and gravel,
are sufficiently plastic to meet the needs of most
users, without being so highly plastic and contractile as
to necessitate admixture with sand or similar material.</p>

<p>Some boulder clays contain limestone in the form
of gravel or as a coarse powder produced by the
crushing of larger fragments. These are less suitable
for manufacturing purposes as the lime produced
when the articles are burned in the kilns is liable to
swell and to disintegrate them on exposure.</p>

<p>Owing to their origin and the nature of the
impurities they contain, boulder clays are never pure
and when burned are irregular in colour and somewhat
fusible unless subjected to some process of purification.</p>

<p class="caption3">SOME CLAYS OF COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE</p>


<p>Although clays occur in deposits of almost all
geological periods, many of them are of little or no
commercial value. This may be due to their situation
or to their composition and other characteristics.
Thus, a Coal Measure clay is ordinarily quite inaccessible,
and to sink a shaft specially to obtain it
may be an unprofitable undertaking; if, however,
a shaft is sunk for coal the clays in the neighbourhood
of the coal seams are rendered accessible and,
usually, a certain amount of such clays is brought to
the surface in order to remove it out of the way of
the coal miners.</p>

<p>Again, a clay deposit may be so far removed from
human habitations as to make it practically valueless,
but if, for any reason, the population of the
district in which the clay is situated grows sufficiently,
the clay may become of considerable value. It not
infrequently happens, therefore, that the commercial
importance of a clay deposit is one which fluctuates
considerably, yet, in spite of this fact, there are certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
kinds of clay which are nearly always of some commercial
value. The most important of these are the
kaolins (china clays), the pottery and stoneware clays,
the refractory clays (fireclays), the brick and terra-cotta
clays and shales, and the clays used in the
manufacture of Portland cement. The origin and
manner in which these clays have been accumulated
have been described in the previous chapters; it now
remains to indicate their characteristics from the
point of view of their commercial value.</p>

<p><b>Commercial china clays and kaolins</b> in the
United Kingdom are not simple natural products but,
in the state in which they are sold commercially, have
all been subjected to a careful treatment with water,
followed by a process of sedimentation whereby the
bulk of the impurities have been removed. According
to the extent to which this treatment has
been carried out, they will contain 10 per cent. or more
mica and quartz, with little or no tourmaline, felspar
and undecomposed granite. In some parts of Europe
and America, kaolins are found in a state of
sufficient purity to need no treatment of this kind
unless they are to be used for the very highest class
of wares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Mica is usually the chief impurity as its particles
are so small and their density resembles that of the
purified china clay more closely than do the other
minerals. In commerce the term <i>china clay</i> is
almost invariably used to denote the washed material
obtained from the 'china clay rock,' but at the pits
the word 'clay' is used indiscriminately for the
carclazite (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>) and for the material obtained from
it. As the term 'kaolin' is used indifferently abroad
for the crude 'deposit' and for the purified commercial
article, it should be understood that the
following information relates solely to the substance
as usually sold and not to the crude material.</p>

<p>Commercial china clay or kaolin is a soft white
or faintly yellowish substance, easily reduced to an
extremely fine powder, which when mixed with twice
its weight of water will pass completely through a
No. 200 sieve. Its specific gravity is 2&middot;65, but the
minuteness and nature of its smallest particles and
their character are such that it will remain in suspension
in water for several days; it thus appears to
possess colloidal properties, at any rate so far as the
smaller particles are concerned. It is almost infusible,
but shows signs of softening at 1880&deg; C. (Seger Cone 39)
or at a somewhat lower temperature, according to the
proportion of impurities present. When heated with
silica or with various metallic oxides it fuses more
readily owing to the formation of silicates.</p>

<p>China clays and kaolins are not appreciably affected
by dilute acids, but some specimens are partially
decomposed by boiling concentrated hydrochloric
acid (<a href="#Bibl_26">26</a>) and all are decomposed by boiling sulphuric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
acid, the alumina being dissolved and the silica
liberated in a form easily soluble in solutions of
caustic soda or potash. This has led to the conclusion
that some kaolins may have been produced by
weathering, as the bulk of true kaolinitic clays (such
as Cornish china clay) is not affected by boiling
hydrochloric acid (<a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>).</p>

<p>Owing to the exceptional minuteness of its
particles, it is extremely difficult to ascertain whether
pure china clay or kaolin is crystalline or amorphous.
Johnson and Blake (<a href="#Bibl_21">21</a>) found that all the specimens
they examined 'consisted largely of hexagonal plates'
and that in most kaolins 'these plates are abundant&mdash;evidently
constituting the bulk of the substance.'
This observation is contrary to the experience of
most investigators, the majority of whom have found
the bulk of the material to be amorphous and sponge-like,
but a small portion of it to consist of hexagonal
or rhombic crystals.</p>

<p>Mellor (<a href="#Bibl_22">22</a>) has proposed the name <i>clayite</i> for
this amorphous material, the crystalline portion being
termed <i>kaolinite</i> as suggested by Johnson and Blake.</p>

<p>Both kaolinite (crystalline) and clayite (amorphous)
yield the same results on analysis and
correspond very closely to the formula H<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub> or
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>2SiO<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O, so that it is most probable that they
are the same substance in different physical states.</p>

<p>According to Hickling (<a href="#Bibl_36">36</a>) the general impression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
that the particles of china clay are amorphous is due
to the use of microscopes of insufficient power. With
an improved instrument, Hickling claims to have
identified the 'amorphous' portion of china clay with
crystalline kaolinite, the clay particles (<a href="#Fig_17">fig. 17</a>) being
in the form of irregular, curved, hexagonal prisms or
in isolated plates. The former show strong transverse
cleavages. The index of refraction and that of double
refraction agree with those of Anglesea kaolinite
crystals, as does the specific gravity.</p>

<p>In spite of their great purity, commercial china
clays and kaolins are almost devoid of plasticity, nor
can this property be greatly increased by any artificial
treatment. This has led to the conclusion that
plasticity is not an essential characteristic of the
clayite or kaolinite molecules, but is due to physical
causes not shown by any investigation of the chemical
composition of the material.</p>

<p>In addition to the specially purified kaolins just
described, alkaline kaolins, siliceous kaolins and
ferruginous kaolins are obtained from less pure rocks
and do not undergo so thorough a treatment with
water. Some of these varieties are not improbably
derived from transported kaolins, as they occur in
Tertiary strata, and so bear some resemblance to the
white fireclays on the Carboniferous limestone of
Staffordshire, Derbyshire and North Wales, though
the latter are far more plastic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>To be of value, a china clay or kaolin must be as
white as possible and must be free from more than
an insignificant percentage of metallic oxides which
will produce a colour when the clay is heated to
bright redness. If the material is to be used in the
manufacture of paper, paint or ultra-marine, these
colour-producing oxides are of less importance providing
that the clay is sufficiently white in its
commercial state.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of china-ware and porcelain
requires china clay or kaolin which, in addition to the
foregoing characteristics, shall be highly refractory.
It must, therefore, be free from more than about
2 per cent. of lime, magnesia, soda, potash, titanic
acid and other fluxes.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that all white clays of
slight plasticity are china clays or kaolins. Some
<i>pipe clays</i> have these characteristics, but they contain
so large a proportion of impurities as to be useless for
the purposes for which china clay is employed and
are consequently of small value.</p>

<p>Users of china clays and kaolins generally find it
necessary to carry out a lengthy series of tests before
accepting material from a new source, as such a
material may possess characteristics not readily
shown by ordinary methods of analysis, but which
are sufficiently active to make it useless for certain
purposes (see <a href="#Page_143">p. 143</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Pottery clays</b> are, as their name implies, those
used in the manufacture of pottery, and comprise the
china clays already mentioned (<a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>), the ball clays
and the less pure clays used in the manufacture of
coarse red ware, flower pots, etc.</p>

<p>The <i>china clays</i> (<a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>) are not used alone in
pottery manufacture as they lack plasticity and
cohesion. In the production of china-ware or porcelain
they are mixed with a fluxing material such as
Cornish stone, pegmatite, or felspar, together with
quartz or bone ash. Thus, English china ware is
produced from a mixture of approximately equal
parts of bone ash, china clay and Cornish stone,
whilst felspathic or hard porcelain is made from a
mixture of kaolin, felspar and quartz, a little chalk
being sometimes added.</p>

<p>The <i>ball clays</i> (<a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>) form the basis of most
ordinary pottery, though some china clay is usually
added in order to produce a whiter ware. Flint is
added to reduce the shrinkage&mdash;which would otherwise
be inconveniently great&mdash;and the strength of
the finished ware is increased, its texture is rendered
closer and its capability of emitting a ringing sound
when struck are produced by the inclusion of Cornish
stone or felspar in the mixture. Small quantities of
cobalt oxide are also added to improve the whiteness
in the better classes of ware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The ball clays are characterised by their remarkably
high plasticity, their fine texture and their freedom
from grit. They are by no means so pure as the
china clays, and unless carefully selected can only
be used for common ware.</p>

<p>The better qualities burn to a vitrified mass of
a light brownish tint, but when mixed with the other
materials used in earthenware manufacture they
should produce a perfectly white ware. The inferior
qualities are used for stoneware, drain pipes, etc. It
should be noted that the term 'ball clay' is used for
clays of widely differing characteristics though all
obtained from one geological formation; when ordering
it is necessary to state the purpose for which the
clay is required or an entirely unsuitable material
may be supplied. For the same reason, great care is
needed in any endeavour to sell a ball clay from an
hitherto unworked deposit.</p>

<p><i>Coarse pottery clays</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> are usually found near the
surface and whilst they may be derived from any
geological formation, those most used in England
are of Triassic or Permian origin, though some small
potteries use material of other periods, including
alluvial or surface clays. These clays are closely
allied to those used for brickmaking, but are somewhat
finer in texture and more plastic. In some cases
they are prepared from brick clays by treating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
latter in a wash-mill, the coarser particles being then
removed, whilst the finer ones, in the state of a slip
or slurry, are run into a settling tank and are there
deposited.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Coarse pottery has been defined as that made from natural clay
without the addition of any material other than sand and water.</p></div>

<p>The presence of a considerable proportion of iron
oxide results in the formation of red ware, which is
necessarily of a porous nature, as the fluxes in the
clay are such that they will not permit of its being
heated to complete vitrification without loss of shape.
To render it impervious the ware is covered with
a glaze, usually producing red, brown or black ware
(Rockingham ware).</p>

<p>The <i>stoneware</i> or <i>drain-pipe clays</i>, are the most
important of the <i>vitrifiable clays</i> and owe their value
to the fact that they can be readily used for the
manufacture of impervious ware without the necessity
of employing a glaze. They are, therefore, used in the
manufacture of vessels for holding corrosive liquids
such as acids and other chemicals, for sanitary appliances,
sewerage pipes and in many other instances
where an impervious material is required.</p>

<p>Owing to the lime, magnesia, potash and soda
they contain, the stoneware clays undergo partial
fusion at a much lower temperature than is required by
some of the purer clays. The fused portion fills the
pores or interstices of the material, making&mdash;when
cold&mdash;a ware of great strength and impermeability.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty experienced in the manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of stoneware is the liability of the articles to twist and
warp when heated. For this reason it is necessary
to burn them very carefully and to select the clays
with circumspection. Some clays are quite unsuitable
for this branch of pottery manufacture because of
the practical impossibility of producing ware which
is correct in shape and is free from warping.</p>

<p>What is required are clays in which the partial
fusion will commence at a moderate temperature and
will continue until all the pores are filled with the
fused material without the remaining ingredients
being attacked or corroded sufficiently to cause the
ware to lose its shape. As the temperature inside
a potter's kiln is continually rising, the great tendency
is for the production of fused material to take place
at an ever-increasing rate, so that the danger of
warping becomes greater as the firing nears completion.
Some clays commence to vitrify at a moderate
temperature and can be heated through a long
range of temperature before an appreciable amount
of warping occurs; such clays are said to possess
a 'long range of vitrification' (<a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>). In other clays
the difference between the temperature at which
vitrification commences and that at which loss of
shape occurs is only a few degrees; such clays are
useless for the manufacture of stoneware, as their
vitrification range is too short. It is therefore
essential that, for the manufacture of stoneware,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a clay should contain a large proportion of refractory
material which will form a 'skeleton,' the interstices
of which will be filled by the more fusible silicates
produced by the firing.</p>

<p>It is generally found that of all the fluxes present
in vitrifiable clays, soda and potash compounds&mdash;the
so-called 'alkalies'&mdash;and all lime compounds are
the most detrimental, as in association with clay they
form a material with a very short range of vitrification.
Magnesia, on the contrary, accompanies a long
vitrification range.</p>

<p>The clays used in Great Britain for the manufacture
of the best stoneware are the Devonshire and
Dorset ball clays, the upper portions of these deposits
being used for this purpose as they are somewhat less
pure than the lower portions used in the manufacture
of white ware. For coarser grades of stoneware,
clays of other geological formations are employed,
especially where the finished ware may be coloured,
as the purity of the clay is of less importance. Providing
a clay has a sufficiently long vitrification range,
a suitable colour when burned, and that it is capable
of being readily formed into the desired shapes, its
composition and origin are of small importance to
the stoneware manufacturer. In actual practice, however,
the number of sources of good stoneware clay
is distinctly limited, and many manufacturers are thus
compelled to add suitable fluxes to refractory clays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in order to meet some of their customers' requirements.
For this purpose a mixture of fireclay with
finely powdered felspar or Cornish stone is used.
Chalk&mdash;which is a cheaper and more powerful flux&mdash;or
powdered glass cannot be used as the range of
vitrification of the mixture would be too short.</p>

<p>Some manufacturers take the opposite course and
add fireclay, flint, or other refractory material to
a readily fusible clay. This is satisfactory if the
latter clay is relatively low in lime and owes its
fusibility to potash, soda or magnesia in the form
of mica or felspar. The mica and felspar grains
enter so slowly into combination with the clay that
a long range of vitrification occurs, whereas with lime,
or with some other soda and potash compounds, the
combination occurs with great rapidity and the shape
of the ware is spoiled.</p>

<p>The <b>refractory clays</b> are commonly known as
<i>fireclays</i> on account of their resistance to heat. The
china clays and kaolins are also refractory, but are
too expensive and are not sufficiently plastic to be
used commercially in the same manner as fireclays,
except to a very limited extent, though bricks have
been made for many years from the inferior portions
of china clay rock at Tregoning Hill in Cornwall.</p>

<p>The geological occurrence of the fireclays of the
Coal Measures has already been described on <a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>.
In addition, there are the refractory clays occurring in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
pockets or depressions in the Mountain Limestone of
North Wales, Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Ireland,
which consist of siliceous clays and sands, the insoluble
residue of the local dissolution of the limestone,
intermixed with the débris of the overlying Millstone
Grit (see <a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>). These clays and sands can be mixed
to produce bricks of remarkably low shrinkage, but
the pockets are only large enough to enable comparatively
small works to be erected and the clays
are so irregular both in composition and distribution
as to render their use somewhat speculative.</p>

<p>A third type of refractory clay&mdash;termed <i>flint clay</i>&mdash;is
used in large quantities in the United States,
but is seldom found in Great Britain. When
moistened, flint clays do not soften, but remain hard
and flint-like with a smooth shell-like fracture. For
use they are ground extremely fine, but even then
they develop little plasticity. They are considered
by Ries (<a href="#Bibl_6">6</a>) to have been formed by solution and
re-precipitation of the clay subsequent to its primary
formation, in a manner similar to flint. They are
somewhat rich in alumina and many contain crystals of
pholerite (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>2SiO<sub>2</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>

<p>The Coal Measure fireclays (<a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>)&mdash;which are by
far the most important&mdash;are divided into two sections
by the coal seams, those above the coal being shaly
and fissile in structure whilst those below (<i>underclays</i>)
are without any distinct lamination. Both these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
clays may be equally refractory, but the underclays
are those to which the term fireclay is usually applied.
The lowest portions are usually more silicious and in
some areas are so rich in silica as to be more appropriately
termed silica rock or <i>ganister</i>. Fireclays
may, in fact, be looked upon as a special term for
the grey clays of the Coal Measures, interstratified
with and generally in close proximity to the seams
of coal. They are known locally as <i>clunches</i> and
<i>underclays</i> and were at one time supposed to represent
the soil that produced the vegetation from which the
coal was formed, but are now considered by many
authorities to be of estuarine origin.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that whilst the coals
almost invariably occur in association with underclays,
some fireclays are found at a considerable distance
from coal.</p>

<p>The fireclays of the Coal Measures have a composition
varying within comparatively wide limits
even in contiguous strata; those chiefly used having
an average of 20 to 30 per cent. of alumina and 50 to
70 per cent. of silica. They appear to consist of a
mixture of clay and quartz with a small proportion
of other minerals, but in some of them a portion of
the clay is replaced by halloysite&mdash;another hydro-alumino-silicate
with the formula</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p><p>H<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>10</sub> or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.2SiO<sub>2</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Their grey colour is largely due to vegetable
(carbonaceous) matter and to iron compounds. The
latter&mdash;usually in the form of pyrites&mdash;is detrimental
to the quality of the goods as it forms a readily
fusible slag. Unlike the iron in red-burning clays it
can seldom be completely oxidized and so rendered
harmless. The fireclays must therefore be carefully
selected by the miners.</p>

<p>On the Continent, and to a much smaller extent
in Great Britain, refractory articles are made from
mixtures of grog or burned fireclay with just sufficient
raw clay to form a mass of the required strength.
For this purpose a highly plastic, refractory clay is
required and the Tertiary ball clays of Devon and
Dorset (<a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>) are particularly suitable.</p>

<p>The most important characteristics of a fireclay
are that it shall be able to resist any temperature to
which it may be exposed and that the articles into
which it is made shall not be affected by rapid
changes in temperature. Other characteristics of
importance in some industries are the resistance to
corrosive action of slags and vapours, to cutting and
abrasion by dust in flue-gases or by the implements
used in cleaning the fires. For those purposes it is
necessary that a fireclay should possess high infusibility
(<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>), a low burning shrinkage (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>) and a high
degree of refractoriness (<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>), and before it is used
these characteristics should be ascertained by means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of definite tests, as they cannot be determined by
inspection of a sample or from a study of its chemical
analysis.</p>

<p>Several grades of fireclay have long been recognized
on the Continent and in the United States of America,
but the recent Specification of the Institution of Gas
Engineers is the only official recognition in Great
Britain of definite grades. This specification defines
as No. 1 grade a fireclay which shows no signs of
fusion when heated to 1670&deg; C. or Cone 30 at the
rate of 10&deg; C. per minute, and as No. 2 grade fireclay
those which show no signs of fusion when similarly
heated to 1580&deg; C. or Cone 26.</p>

<p>It is regarded as a sign of fusion if a test piece
with sharp angles loses its angularity after heating to
a predetermined temperature (see <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>).</p>

<p>It is customary to regard as 'fireclay' all clays
which, when formed into the shape of a Seger Cone
(<a href="#Fig_6">fig. 6</a>) do not bend on heating slowly until a temperature
of 1580&deg; C. (Cone 26) is reached. Any clays
comprised within this definition and yet not sufficiently
refractory to be of the No. 2 grade just mentioned
may be regarded as No. 3 grade fireclays. Many of
the last named are well suited for the manufacture
of blocks for domestic fireplaces, for glazed bricks
and for firebricks not intended to resist furnace
temperatures.</p>

<p>To resist sudden changes in temperature the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
material must be very porous&mdash;the article being
capable of absorbing at least one-sixth of its volume
of water. For this reason it is customary to mix fireclays
with a large proportion of non-plastic material
of a somewhat coarse texture, the substance most
generally employed being fireclay which has been
previously burned and then crushed. This material is
known as <i>grog</i> or <i>chamotte</i> and has the advantage
over other substances of not affecting the composition
of the fireclay to which it is added, whilst greatly
increasing its technical usefulness. The addition of
grog also reduces the shrinkage of the clay during
drying and ensures a sounder article being produced.</p>

<p>The most serious impurities in refractory clays are
lime, magnesia, soda, potash and titanium and their
compounds as they lower the refractoriness of the
material. Iron, in the state of ferric oxide is of less
importance, but pyrites and all ferrous compounds
are particularly objectionable. Pyritic and calcareous
nodules may, to a large extent, be removed by picking,
and by throwing away lumps in which they are seen
to occur. There is, at present, no other means of
removing them.</p>

<p>Fireclays may be ground directly they come from
the mine, but it is usually better to expose them to the
action of the weather as this effects various chemical
and physical changes within the material, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
improves its quality as well as reduces the power
required to crush it.</p>

<p>To take full advantage of the refractory qualities
of a clay it is necessary to select it with skill, prepare
and mould it with care, to burn it slowly and steadily,
to finish the heating at a sufficiently high temperature
and to cool the ware slowly.</p>

<p>Rapidly heated fireclay is seldom so resistant to
heat under commercial conditions as that which has
been more steadily fired. Rapid or irregular heating
causes an irregular formation and distribution of the
fused material during the process of vitrification
(<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>) and so produces goods which are too tender
to be durable. It is, therefore, necessary to exercise
great care in the firing.</p>

<p><b>Shales</b> are rocks which have been subjected to
considerable pressure subsequent to their deposition
and are, consequently, laminated and more readily
split in one direction than in others. Some shales
are almost entirely composed of silica or calcareous
matter, but many others are rich in clay, the term
referring to physical structure and not to chemical
composition. The clay-shales occur chiefly in the
Silurian and Carboniferous formations, the latter
being more generally used by clayworkers.</p>

<p>Clay-shales are valued according to (<i>a</i>) the proportion
of oil which can be distilled from them, those
rich in this respect being termed <i>oil shales</i>; (<i>b</i>) the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
colour when burned, as in <i>brickmaking and terra-cotta
shales</i>; (<i>c</i>) the refractoriness, as in <i>fireclay
shales</i> and (<i>d</i>) the facility with which they are
decomposed on exposure or on heating and form
sulphuric acid as in <i>alum shales</i>.</p>

<p><i>Oil shales</i> contain so much carbonaceous matter
that on distillation at a low red heat they yield
commercially remunerative quantities of a crude oil
termed <i>shale tar</i>. In composition they are intermediate
between cannel coal and a purely mineral
shale. To be of value they should not yield less than
30 gallons of crude oil per ton of shale, with ammonia
and illuminating gas as by-products. They are of
Silurian, Carboniferous or Oolitic origin, the Kimeridge
shale associated with the last-named being very
valuable in this respect.</p>

<p>The most important oil shales occur in Scotland.</p>

<p>The <i>fireclay shales</i> have already been described
on pages 53 and 116.</p>

<p>The <i>brickmaking shales</i> are those which are
sufficiently rich in clay to form a plastic paste when
ground and mixed with water. They can be made
into bricks of excellent colour and great strength, but
for this purpose require the use of powerful crushing
and mixing machinery. They are usually converted
into a stiff paste of only moderate plasticity and are
then moulded by machinery in specially designed
presses, though some firebricks are made from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
crushed shale mixed into a soft paste with water
and afterwards moulded by hand. Some shales, such
as the <i>knotts</i> at Fletton near Peterborough are not
made into a paste, the moist powdered shale being
pressed into bricks by very powerful machinery.</p>

<p>Brickmaking shales may be found in any of the
older geological formations, though they occur chiefly
in the Silurian, Permian, Carboniferous and Jurassic
systems. The purer shales of the Coal Measures
burn to an agreeable cream or buff colour, the less
pure ones and those of the other formations mentioned
produce articles of a brick-red or blue-grey
colour.</p>

<p>Where the shales are of exceptionally fine grain
and their colour when burned is very uniform and
of a pleasing tint they are known as <i>terra-cotta</i>
shales, the red terra-cottas being chiefly made from
those occurring in Wales and the buff ones from the
lower grade fireclays of the Coal Measures.</p>

<p><i>Alum shales</i> are characterised by a high proportion
of pyrites, which, on roasting, form ferrous
sulphate and sulphuric acid. The latter combines
with the alumina in the shale and when the roasted ore
is extracted with water a solution of iron sulphate and
aluminium sulphate is obtained. From this solution
(after partial evaporation) alum crystals are obtained
by the addition of potassium or ammonium sulphate.</p>

<p>The chief alum shales are those of the Silurian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
formation in Scotland and Scandinavia. The Liassic
shales of Whitby were at one time an equally important
source of alum.</p>

<p>During recent years a large amount of alum has
been obtained from other sources or has been made
from the lower grade Dorset and Devonshire ball
clays by calcining them and then treating them with
sulphuric acid. These clays being almost free from
iron compounds yield a much purer alum at a lower
cost.</p>

<p><b>Brick clays</b> are those which are not suitable&mdash;either
from nature or situation&mdash;for the manufacture
of pottery or porcelain and yet possess sufficient
plasticity to enable them to be made into bricks.
The term is used somewhat loosely, and geologists
not infrequently apply it to clays which are quite
unsuitable for brickmaking on account of excessive
shrinkage and the absence of any suitable non-plastic
medium. Large portions of the 'London clay' are
of this nature and can only be regarded as of use
to brick- and roofing-tile-manufacturers when the
associated Bagshot sands are readily accessible. Similarly,
some of the very tough surface clays of the
Northern and Midland counties are equally valueless,
though designated 'brick clays' in numerous geological
and other reports. It is, therefore, necessary
to remember that, as ordinarily used, the term 'brick
clay' merely indicates a material which appears at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
first sight to be suitable for brickmaking, but that
more detailed investigations are necessary before it
can be ascertained whether a material so designated
is actually suitable for the purpose.</p>

<p>It is also important to observe that local industrial
conditions may be such that a valuable clay may be
used for brickmaking because there is a demand for
bricks, but not for the other articles for which the
clay is equally suitable. For instance, a considerable
number of houses in Northumberland and Durham
were built of firebricks at a time when it was more
profitable to sell these articles for domestic buildings
than for furnaces.</p>

<p>In many ways the bricks used for internal
structural work form the simplest and most easily
manufactured of all articles made from clay. The
colour of the finished product is of minor importance
and so long as a brick of reasonably accurate shape
and of sufficient strength is produced at a cheap rate,
little else is expected.</p>

<p>Impurities&mdash;unless in excessively large proportions&mdash;are
of small importance and, indeed, sand may
almost be considered an essential constituent of a
material to be used for making ordinary bricks. It
is, therefore, possible to utilize for this purpose some
materials containing so little 'clay' as to make them
scarcely fit to be included in this term. So long as
the adventitious materials consist chiefly of silica and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
chalk and the mixture is sufficiently plastic to make
strong bricks, it may be used satisfactorily in spite of
its low content of clay, but if the so-called 'brick
clay' contains limestone, either in large grains or
nodules, it will be liable to burst the bricks or to
produce unsightly 'blow-holes' on their surfaces. If
too much sand or other non-plastic material is
present, the resulting bricks will be too weak to be
satisfactory.</p>

<p>No brick clay can be regarded as 'safe' if it
contains nodules of limestone&mdash;unless these can be
removed during the preparation of the material&mdash;or
if the resulting bricks will not show a crushing
strength of at least 85 tons per square foot.</p>

<p>The introduction of machinery in place of hand-moulding
and of kilns instead of clamps has greatly
raised the standard of strength, accuracy in shape
and uniformity in colour in many districts, and many
builders in the Midlands now expect to sort out from
the 'common bricks' purchased, a sufficient number
of superior quality to furnish all the 'facing bricks'
they require. Apart from this, and in districts where
buildings are faced with stone or with bricks of a
superior quality, the 'stock' or 'common brick' may
be made from almost any clay which will bear drying
and heating to redness without shrinking excessively
or cracking. A linear shrinkage of 1 in. per foot
(= 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent.) may be regarded as the maximum with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
most materials used for brickmaking. Clays which
shrink more than this must have a suitable quantity
of grog, sand, chalk, ashes or other suitable non-plastic
material added.</p>

<p>If the clay contains much ferric oxide it will
produce red or brown bricks according to the
temperature reached in the kiln, but if much chalk
is also present (or is added purposely) a combined
lime-iron-silicate is produced and the bricks will be
white in colour. If only a small percentage of ferric
oxide is present a clay will produce buff bricks,
which will be spotted with minute black specks or
larger masses of a greyish black slag if pyrites are also
present or if ferrous silicate has been produced by
the reduction of the iron compounds and their
subsequent combination with silica.</p>

<p>Further information on brick earths will be found
on page 67.</p>

<p>A description of the processes used in the manufacture
of bricks being outside the scope of the
present work, the reader requiring information on
this subject should consult <i>Modern Brickmaking</i> (<a href="#Bibl_25">25</a>)
or some similar treatise.</p>

<p><i>Roofing tiles</i> require clays of finer texture than
those which may be made into bricks. Stones, if
present, must be removed by washing or other treatment,
as it is seldom that they can be crushed to a
sufficiently fine powder, unless only rough work is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
required. If sufficiently fine, the clay used for
roofing tiles may be precisely the same as that used
for bricks and is treated in a similar manner. It
must, however, be of such a nature that it will not
warp or twist during the burning; it must, therefore,
have a long range of vitrification (<a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>).</p>

<p><i>Terra-cotta</i> is an Italian term signifying baked
earth, but its meaning is now limited to those articles
made of clay which are not classed as pottery, such as
statues, large vases, pillars, etc., modelled work used
in architecture, or for external decoration. Although
the distinction cannot be rigidly maintained, articles
made of clay may be roughly divided into</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Pottery (<i>faience</i>) and porcelain (glazed),</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Terra-cotta (unglazed),</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Bricks and unglazed tiles devoid of decoration.</p>

<p>In this sense, terra-cotta occupies an intermediate
position between pottery and bricks, but no satisfactory
definition has yet been found for it. Thus, bricks
with a modelled or moulded ornament are, strictly,
terra-cotta, yet are not so named, and some pottery
is unglazed and yet is never classed as terra-cotta,
whilst glazed bricks are never regarded as pottery.
Again during the past few years, what is termed
'glazed terra-cotta' has been largely used for architectural
purposes, yet this is really 'faience.'</p>

<p>Although this overlapping of terms may appear
confusing to the reader, it does not cause any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
appreciable amount of inconvenience to the manufacturers
or users, as it is not difficult for a practical
clayworker to decide in which of the three classes
mentioned a given article should be placed.</p>

<p>Partly on account of the lesser weight, but chiefly
in order to reduce the tendency to crack and to
facilitate drying and burning, terra-cotta articles are
usually made hollow.</p>

<p>It is necessary that clays used in the manufacture
of terra-cotta should be of so fine a texture that the
finest modelling can be executed. Such clays occur
naturally in several geological formations, and some
may be prepared from coarser materials by careful
washing, whereby the larger grains of sand, stones, etc.,
are removed. Some shales, when finely ground, make
excellent clays for architectural terra-cotta, portions
of all the better known fireclay deposits being used
for this purpose. It is, however, necessary to use
only those shales which are naturally of fine texture,
as mechanical grinding cannot effect a sufficient
sub-division of the particles of some of the coarser
shales.</p>

<p>The finer Triassic 'marls' are also admirable for
terra-cotta work, the most famous deposit being the
Etruria Marl Series in the Upper Coal Measures near
Ruabon.</p>

<p>The most important characteristics required in
terra-cotta clays are (<i>a</i>) fine texture, or at any rate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the ability to yield a fine, dense surface, (<i>b</i>) small
shrinkage with little tendency to twist, warp or crack
in firing, (<i>c</i>) pleasing and uniform colour when fired,
and (<i>d</i>) a sufficient proportion of fluxes to make it
resistant to weather without giving a glossy appearance
to the finished product.</p>

<p>In large pieces of terra-cotta some irregularity
of shape is almost unavoidable, but, if care is taken
in the selection and manipulation of the material, this
need not be unsightly.</p>

<p>The durability of terra-cotta is largely dependent
on the nature of the surface. The most suitable
clays, when fired, have a thin 'skin' of vitrified
material which is very resistant to climatic influences,
and so long as this remains intact the ware will
continue in perfect condition. If this 'skin' is removed,
rain will penetrate the material and under
the influence of frost may cause rapid disintegration.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of very large pieces of terra-cotta
a coarse, porous clay is used for the foundation
and interior, and this is covered with the finer clay.
By this means a greater resistance to changes in
temperature is secured, the drying and the burning
of the material in the kiln are facilitated and the
risks of damage in manufacture are materially
reduced.</p>

<p><b>Cement clays</b> are those used in the manufacture
of Portland cement and of so-called natural cements.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
They are largely of an alluvial character and are of
two chief classes: (<i>a</i>) those which contain chalk or
limestone dust and clay in proportions suitable for the
manufacture of cement and (<i>b</i>) those to which chalk
or ground limestone must be added.</p>

<p>They vary in composition from argillaceous limestones
containing only a small proportion of clay to
almost pure clays.</p>

<p>The manufacture of Portland cement has assumed
a great importance and owing to the large amount
of investigations made in connection with it, it may
be said to represent the chief cement made from
argillaceous materials, the others being convenient
though crude modifications of it.</p>

<p>The essential constituents are calcium carbonate
(introduced in the form of chalk or powdered limestone)
and clay, the composition of the naturally
occurring materials being modified by the addition
of a suitable proportion of one or other of these
ingredients. The material is then heated until it
undergoes partial fusion and a 'clinker' is formed.
This clinker, when ground, forms the cement.</p>

<p>In Kent, the Medway mud is mixed with chalk;
in Sussex, a mixture of gault clay and chalk is
employed; in the Midlands and South Wales, Liassic
shales and limestone are used; in Northumberland a
mixture of Kentish chalk and a local clay is preferred,
and in Cambridgeshire a special marl lying between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the Chalk and the Greensand is found to be admirable
for the purpose because it contains the ingredients
in almost exactly the required proportions.</p>

<p>For cement manufacture, clays should be as free
as possible from material which, in slip form, will
not pass through a No. 100 sieve, as coarse sand and
other rock débris are practically inert. The proportion
of alumina and iron should be about one-third, but
not more than one-half, that of the silica, and in
countries where the proportion of magnesia in a
cement is limited by standard specifications, it will
be found undesirable to use clays containing more
than 3 per cent. of magnesia and alkalies.</p>

<p>Whilst calcareous clays usually prove the most
convenient in the manufacture of cement, it is by no
means essential to use them, and where a clay almost
free from lime occurs in convenient proximity to
a suitable chalk or limestone deposit an excellent
cement may usually be manufactured.</p>

<p>The 'clays' from which the so-called 'natural' or
'Roman cements' are made by simple calcination and
crushing, usually fuse at a lower temperature than do
the mixtures used for Portland cement, and unless
their composition is accurately adjusted they yield a
product of such variable quality as to be unsuitable
for high class work.</p>

<p><b>Fuller's earth</b> is a term used to indicate any
earthy material which can be employed for fulling or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
degreasing wool and bleaching oil. True fuller's earth
is obtained chiefly from the neighbourhood of Reigate,
Surrey, Woburn Sands, Bedfordshire and from below
the Oolite formation near Bath, but owing to the
scarcity of the material and the irregularity of its
behaviour, china clay is now largely used for the same
purpose. True fuller's earth is much more fusible
than the white clays usually substituted for it, and
when mixed with water it does not form a plastic
paste but falls to powder. As the chief requirement
of the fuller is the grease-absorbing power of the
material there is no objection to the substitution of
other earths of equal efficiency.</p>

<p>Fuller's earth does not appear to be a true clay,
though its constitution and mineralogical composition
are by no means clearly known. T. J. Porter considers
that it is chiefly composed of montmorillonite
(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>4SiO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O), anauxite, (2Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>9SiO<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O), and
chalk with some colloidal silica and a little quartz.
It therefore appears to resemble the less pure kaolins,
but to contain little or no true clay, though in many
respects it behaves in a manner similar to a kaolin
of unusually low plasticity.</p>

<p><b>Other clays</b> of commercial importance, with
further details of the ones just mentioned, are
described in the author's <i>British Clays, Shales and
Sands</i> (<a href="#Bibl_2">2</a>).</p>

<p class="caption3">CLAY SUBSTANCE: THEORETICAL AND ACTUAL</p>


<p>Having indicated the origin, modes of accumulation
and general characteristics of the
numerous materials known as 'clay,' it now remains
to ascertain what substance, if any, is contained in
all of them and may be regarded as their essential
constituent, to which their properties are largely
due. Just as the value of an ore is dependent to
a very large extent on the proportion of the desired
metal which it contains, and just as coal is largely,
though not entirely, esteemed in proportion to the
percentage of carbon and hydrogen in it, so there
may be an essential substance in clays to which they
owe the most important of their characteristics.</p>

<p>The proportion of metal in an ore or of hydrocarbon
in a coal can be ascertained without serious
difficulty by some means of analysis, but with clay
the difficulties are so great that, to some extent at
least, they must be regarded as being, for the present,
insurmountable. This is in no small measure due to
the general recognition of all minerals or rocks which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
become plastic when kneaded with water as 'clays'
without much regard being paid to their composition.
Consequently materials of the most diverse nature
in other respects are termed clays if they are known
to become plastic under certain conditions.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, at the present time, no generally
accepted definition of clay which distinguishes it
from mixtures of clay and sand or other fine mineral
particles. The usual geological definitions are so
broad as to include many mixtures containing considerably
less than half their weight of true clay or
they avoid the composition of the material altogether
and describe it as a finely divided product of the
decomposition of rocks.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to avoid this
unfortunate position, which is alike unsatisfactory to
the geologist, the mineralogist and the chemist as
well as to the large number of people engaged in the
purchase and use of various clays; and, whilst the end
sought has not been reached as completely as is
desirable, great progress has been made and much
has been accomplished during the last twenty years.</p>

<p>One of the earliest attempts to ascertain whether
there is an essential constituent of all clays was made
by Seger (<a href="#Bibl_7">7</a>) who used two methods of separating
some of the ingredients of natural clays from the
remaining constituents. The first of these methods
consists in an application of the investigations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Schulze, Schloesing and Schoene on soils, viz. the
removal of the finest particles by elutriation; the
second is an extension of the method of Forschammer
and Fresenius, viz. the treatment of the material with
sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>To the product containing the clay when either
of these methods is used Seger gave the name <i>clay
substance</i>, but the material so separated is by no
means pure clay. The term clay substance must,
therefore, be confined to the crude product containing
the clay together with such other impurities as are in
the form of extremely small particles or are soluble
in sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>It has not yet been found possible to isolate pure
clay from ordinary clays, so that in investigating the
nature of what Seger was endeavouring to produce
when he obtained the crude clay substance, indirect
methods are necessary.</p>

<p>It has long been known that if a sample of 'clay'&mdash;using
this word in the broadest sense&mdash;is rubbed in a
considerable quantity of water so as to form a thin slip
or slurry, it may readily be divided into a number
of fractions each of which will consist of grains of
different sizes. This separation may be effected by
means of a series of sieves through which the slurry
is poured, or the slurry may be caused to flow at a
series of different speeds, the material left behind at
each rate of speed being kept separate; or, finally, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
slurry may be allowed to stand for a few seconds and
may then be carefully decanted into another vessel in
which it may remain at rest for a somewhat longer
period, these times of resting and decantation, if
repeated, providing a series of fractions the materials
in which are more or less different in their nature.</p>

<p>'Clays' containing a considerable proportion of
coarse material are most conveniently separated into
a series of fractions by means of sieves, whereby they
are divided into (i) stones, (ii) gravel, (iii) coarse sand,
(iv) medium sand, (v) fine sand and (vi) a slurry consisting
of such small particles that they can no longer
be separated by sifting. If the residues on the sieves
are carefully washed free from any adhering fine
material and are then dried, they will be found on
examination to be quite distinct from anything definable
as clay. They may consist of a considerable
variety of minerals or may be almost entirely composed
of quartz, but with the possible exception of
some shales of great hardness, they are undoubtedly
not clay. This simple process therefore serves to
remove a proportion of material which in the case of
some 'clays' is very large but in others is insignificant;
thus 40 per cent. of sand-like material may be removed
from some brick-clays whilst a ball clay used for the
manufacture of stoneware or pottery may pass completely
through a sieve having 200 meshes per linear
inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The material which passes through the finest sieve
employed will contain all the true clay in the material;
that is to say, the coarser portion will, as already
mentioned, be devoid of the ordinary characteristics
of clay. At the same time, this very fine material
will seldom consist exclusively of clay, but will usually
contain a considerable proportion of silt, extremely
fine mineral particles and, in the case of calcareous
clays, a notable proportion of calcium carbonate in
the form of chalk or limestone particles. Only in the
case of the purest clays will the material now under
consideration consist entirely of clay, so that it must
be again separated into its constituents. This is
best accomplished, as first suggested by Schoene, by
exposing the material to the action of a stream of
water of definite speed. H. Seger (<a href="#Bibl_7">7</a>) investigated
this method very thoroughly and his recommendations
as to the manner in which this separation by elutriation
should be carried out remain in use at the present
time. Briefly, all material sufficiently fine to be
carried away by a stream of water flowing at the rate
of 0&middot;43 in. per minute was found by Seger to include
the whole of the clay in the samples he examined,
but, as was later pointed out by Bischof, it is not
correct to term the whole of this material 'clay
substance,' as when examined under the microscope,
it contains material which is clearly not clay.</p>

<p>Processes of decantation of the finest material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
obtained after elutriation still fail to separate all the
non-clay material, and Vogt has found that when the
material has been allowed to stand in suspension
for nine days some particles of mica are still associated
with the clay.</p>

<p>It would thus appear that no process of mechanical
separation will serve for a complete purification of a
clay; indeed, there are good reasons for supposing
that extremely fine particles of quartz and mica
render physical characteristics an uncertain means of
accurately distinguishing clays from other rock dust.</p>

<p>When chemical methods of investigation are employed
the problem is not materially altered, nor is
its solution fully attained. It is, of course, obvious
that any chemical method should be applied to the
product obtained by treating the raw material
mechanically as above described, for to do otherwise
is to create needless confusion. Yet by far the greater
number of published analyses of 'clays' report
the ultimate composition of the whole material, no
attempt being made to show how much of the various
constituents is in the form of sand, stones or other
coarse particles of an entirely non-argillaceous
character.</p>

<p>If the particles of a 'clay' which are sufficiently
small to be carried away by a stream of water with a
velocity of only 0&middot;43 in. per minute are analysed, it
will be found that their composition will vary according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to the origin of the clay and the subsequent treatment
to which it has been subjected during its transport
and deposition. If the clay is fairly free from
calcareous material and is of a white-burning nature
it may be found to have a composition like china clays.
Red-burning clays, on the contrary, will vary greatly
in composition, so that it becomes difficult to find
any close analogy between these kinds of clay. This
difference is partly due to the extremely fine state
of division in which ferric oxide occurs in clays, the
particles of this material corresponding in minuteness
to those of the purest clays and so being inseparable
by any mechanical process.</p>

<p>In 1876 H. Seger (<a href="#Bibl_7">7</a>) published what he termed
a method of 'rational analysis,' which consisted in
treating the clay with boiling sulphuric acid followed
by a treatment with caustic soda. He found that the
purer china clays (kaolins) and ball clays were made
soluble by this means and that felspar, mica and
quartz were to a large extent unaffected. Later
investigators have found that this method is only
applicable to a limited extent and that its indications
are only reliable when applied to the clays just named,
but the principle introduced by Seger has proved
invaluable in increasing our knowledge of the composition
of clays. By means of this so-called rational
analysis Seger found that the purer clays yielded
results of remarkable similarity and uniformity, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
material entering into solution having a composition
agreeing very closely with the formula Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>2SiO<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O
which is generally recognized as that of the chief
constituent or constituents of china clay (kaolin) and
the purer ball clays. This crude substance, obtainable
from a large number of clays by the treatment just
described, was named <i>clay substance</i> by Seger, who
regarded it as the essential constituent of all clays.</p>

<p>Red-burning clays when similarly treated do not
yield so uniform a product, and the ferric oxide
entering into solution makes the results very discordant.
Moreover, even with the china clays or
kaolins a small proportion of alkalies, lime and other
oxides enter into solution and a number of minerals
analogous to clay, but quite distinct from it, are also
decomposed and dissolved. For these reasons the
'rational analysis' has been found insufficient; it
is now considered necessary to make an analysis
of the portion rendered soluble by treatment with
sulphuric acid in order to ascertain what other
ingredients it may contain in addition to the true
clay present.</p>

<p>As the china clays (kaolins) and ball clays on very
careful elutriation all yield a product of the same
ultimate composition, viz. 39 per cent. of alumina,
46 per cent. of silica, 13 per cent. of water, and 2 per
cent. of other oxides, they are generally regarded as
consisting of practically pure clay with a variable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
amount of impurities. Many years ago Fresenius
suggested that these non-clayey constituents of clays
should be calculated into the minerals to which they
appeared likely to correspond so as to obtain a result
similar to that obtained by Seger without the disadvantages
of the treatment with sulphuric acid and
as supplementary to such treatment in the case of
red-burning and some other clays. More recent
investigators have found that if a careful microscopic
examination of the clay is made the results of
estimating the composition from the proportion of the
different minerals recognizable under the microscope
and by calculation from the analysis of the material
agree very closely and are, as Bischof (<a href="#Bibl_28">28</a>) and, more
recently, Mellor have pointed out, more reliable than
the 'rational analysis' in the case of impure clays. If
care is taken to make a microscopical examination
identifying the chief impurities present the calculation
from the analysis may usually be accepted as sufficiently
accurate, but it is very unsatisfactory to assume, as
some chemists do, that the alkalies and lime in the
clay are all in the form of felspar and that the silica
remaining in excess of that required to combine with
the alkalies, lime and alumina is free quartz. Some
clays are almost destitute of felspar but comparatively
rich in mica, whilst others are the reverse, so that some
means of identifying the extraneous minerals is essential.
When this is not used, the curious result is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
obtained that German chemists calculate the alkalies,
etc. to felspar whilst the French chemists, following
Vogt, calculate them to mica; English ceramic chemists
appear undecided as to which course to follow, and
some of them occasionally report notable amounts of
felspar in clays quite destitute of this mineral!</p>

<p>A statement of the composition of a 'clay' based
on a mechanical separation of the coarser ingredients
followed by an analysis of the finer ones and a calculation
of the probable constituents of the latter, as
already described, is known as a <i>proximate analysis</i> in
order to distinguish it from an <i>ultimate analysis</i> which
states the composition of the whole material in terms
of its ultimate oxides. A proximate analysis therefore
shows the various materials entering into the composition
of the clay in the following or similar terms:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> In analytical reports a note should be appended stating that the
figure under this term shows the proportion of the nearest approximation
to true clay at present attainable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p></div>

<p>For some purposes it is necessary to show the
proportion of calcium, iron and other compounds
as in an ordinary ultimate analysis.</p>

<p>A comparison of the foregoing with an ultimate or
'ordinary' analysis of a clay (<a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>) will show at
once the advantage of the former in increasing our
knowledge of the essential constituent of all clays, if
such a substance really exists. Its absolute existence
is by no means proved, for, as will have been noticed,
its composition is largely based on assumption even
in the most thorough investigations, particularly of
the admittedly less pure clays.</p>

<p>In the purer clays the problem is much simpler and
in their case an answer of at least approximate accuracy
can be given to the question 'What is clay?'</p>

<p>Even with these purer clays it is not sufficient to
study an analysis showing the total amount of the
silica, alumina and other oxides present; it is still
necessary to effect some kind of separation into the
various minerals of which they are composed. When,
however, the accessory minerals do not exceed 5 per
cent. of the total ingredients their influence is less
important and the nature and characteristics of the
'clay substance' itself can be more accurately studied.
By careful treatment of well selected china clays, for
example, it is possible to obtain a material corresponding
to the formula Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>2SiO<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O within a total
error of 1 per cent., the small amount of impurity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
being, as far as can be ascertained, composed of mica.
So pure a specimen of clay is found on microscopical
examination to consist of minute irregular grains of
no definite form, together with a few crystals of the
same composition and identifiable as the mineral
'kaolinite' (<a href="#Page_107">p. 107</a>). This 'amorphous' material, which
appears to be the chief constituent of all china clays
and kaolins, has been termed <i>clayite</i> by Mellor (<a href="#Bibl_22">22</a>).</p>

<p>Johnson and Blake, Aron and other observers have
stated that the majority of the particles in china clays
and kaolins are crystalline in form. Owing to their
extreme smallness it is exceedingly difficult to prove
that they are not so, though for all ordinary purposes
they may be regarded as amorphous, the proportion
of obviously crystalline matter present in British
china clay of the highest qualities being so small
as to be negligible.</p>

<p>Hickling (<a href="#Bibl_36">36</a>), using an exceptionally powerful
microscope, claims to have identified this 'amorphous'
substance in china clay as 'worn and fragmental
crystals of kaolinite,' and recently Mellor and Holdcroft
and Rieke have shown that the apparently
amorphous material shows the same endo- and
exothermal reactions as crystalline kaolinite.</p>

<p>So far as china clays or kaolins are concerned,
kaolinite or an amorphous substance of the same composition
appears to be identical with the 'ideal clay' or
'true clay' whose characters have so long been sought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>This term&mdash;clayite&mdash;is very convenient when confined
to china clays and kaolins, but it is scarcely
legitimate to apply it, as has been suggested, to
material in other clays until it has been isolated in a
sufficiently pure form to enable its properties to be
accurately studied. This restriction is the more
necessary as in one very important respect clayite
obtained from china clay and some kaolins differs
noticeably from the nearest approach to it obtainable
from the more plastic clays: namely, in its very low
plasticity. This may be explained by the fact that it
is only obtainable in a reasonably pure form in clays
of a primary character, whilst the plastic clays have
usually been transported over considerable areas and
have been subjected to a variety of treatments which
have had a marked effect on their physical character.
Moreover, the fact that the purest 'clay' which can
be isolated from plastic clays appears to be amorphous
and to some extent colloidal greatly increases the
difficulty of obtaining it in a pure state, especially as
no liquid is known which will dissolve it without decomposing
it. The fact that it is not an elementary
substance, but a complex compound of silica, alumina
and the elements of water, also increases the intricacy
of the problem, for these substances occur in other
combinations in a variety of other minerals which
are clearly distinct from clay.</p>

<p>Ever since the publication of Seger's memorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
papers (<a href="#Bibl_7">7</a>), and to a small extent before that time, it
has been generally understood that china clay or
kaolin represented the true essential constituent of
clays, but several investigators have been so imbued
with the idea that all true clay substance must have
a crystalline form that they have frequently used the
term 'kaolinite' to include the 'amorphous' substance
in plastic clays. This is unfortunate as it is by no
means proved that the latter is identical with kaolinite,
and a distinctive term would be of value in preventing
confusion. Other investigators have used the word
'kaolin' with equal freeness, so that whilst it originally
referred to material from a particular hill or ridge in
China<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> it has now entered into general use for all
clays whose composition approximates to that of china
clay (<a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>) in which the plasticity is not well
developed. Thus, in spite of the difference in origin
between many German and French kaolins and the
china clays of Cornwall, it is the custom in Europe
generally to term all these materials 'kaolin.' Yet
they are very different in many respects from the
material originally imported from China.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> <i>Kao-ling</i>
is Chinese for a high ridge or hill.</p></div>

<p>As the essential clay substance has not yet been
isolated in a pure form from the most widely spread
plastic clays, but is largely hypothetical as far as they
are concerned, the author prefers the term <i>pelinite</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
when referring to that portion of any plastic clays
or mixtures of clays with other minerals which may
be regarded as being the constituent to which the
argillaceous portion of the material owes its chief
properties. In china clay and kaolin the 'true clay' is
identical with clayite&mdash;or even with kaolinite (<a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>)&mdash;and
there is great probability that this identity also
holds in the case of the more plastic clays of other
geological formations, but until it is established it
appears wisest to distinguish the hypothetical or
ideal clay common to all clays (if there is such a
substance) by different terms according to the extent
to which its composition and characters of the
materials most closely resembling it are experimentally
known.</p>

<p>The substances most resembling this 'ideal clay'

china clays and kaolins (<a href="#Page_107">p. 107</a>).</p>

physical appearance, but containing free alumina and
free silica (<a href="#Page_80">p. 80</a>).</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Clay Substance.</i> A general term indicating

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Chief Characteristics of 'True Clay'
from Different Sources.</span></p>

<p>In so far as it can be isolated <i>true clay</i> appears to
be an amorphous, or practically amorphous, material
which may under suitable conditions crystallize into
rhombic plates of kaolinite. The particles of which
it is composed are extremely small, being always less
than 0&middot;0004 in. in diameter. They adsorb dyes from
solutions and show other properties characteristic of
colloid substances though in a very variable degree,
some clays appearing to contain a much larger proportion
of colloidal matter than do others. To some
extent the power of adsorption of salts and colouring
matters appears to be connected with the plasticity
(<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) of the material, but this latter property
varies so greatly in clayite or pelinite from different
sources as to make any generalization impossible.</p>

<p>True clay substance appears to be quite white,
any colour present being almost invariably traceable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to ferric compounds or to carbonaceous matter. The
latter is of small importance to potters as it burns
away in the kiln. The specific gravity of clay substance
is 2&middot;65 according to Hecht, the lower figures
sometimes reported being too low. Its hardness is
usually less than that of talc&mdash;the softest substance on
Mohs' scale&mdash;but some shales are so indurated as to
scratch quartz. It is quite insoluble in water and in
dilute solutions of acids or alkalies, but is decomposed
by hydrofluoric acid and by concentrated sulphuric
acid when heated, alumina entering into solution and
silica being precipitated in a colloidal condition.</p>

<p>It absorbs water easily until a definite state of
saturation has been reached, after which it becomes
impervious unless the proportion of water is so large
and the time of exposure so great that the material
falls to an irregular mass which may be converted
into a slurry of uniform consistency by gently stirring
it. With a moderate amount of water, pelinite
develops sufficient plasticity to enable it to be
modelled with facility, but clayite and some specimens
of pelinite are somewhat deficient in this respect. The
pelinitic particles usually possess the capacity to retain
their plasticity after being mixed with considerable
proportions of sand or other non-plastic material and
are then said to possess a high binding power (<a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>).</p>

<p>If a large proportion of water is added to a sample
of clayite or pelinite and the mixture is stirred into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a slurry it will be found to remain turbid for a considerable
time and will not become perfectly clear
even after the lapse of several days. Its power of
remaining in suspension is much influenced by the
presence of even small amounts of soluble salts in
either the water or the clay substance, its precipitation
being hastened by the addition of such salts as
cause a partial coagulation of the colloidal matter
present. Some specimens of clayite and pelinite
retain their suspensibility even in the presence of
salts, but this is only true of a very limited proportion
of the substance. In most cases the presence
of soluble salts causes the larger particles to sink
somewhat rapidly and to carry the finer particles
with them.</p>

<p>The rate at which a slip or ' cream' made of elutriated
clay and water will flow through a small orifice
is dependent on the viscosity of the liquid and this
in turn depends on the amount of colloidal material
present, <i>i.e.</i> on how much of the clay (pelinite) is in
a colloidal form. Its viscosity is greatly affected by
the addition or presence of small quantities of acid or
alkali or of acidic or basic salts. Acids increase the
viscosity; alkalies and basic salts, on the contrary,
make the slip more fluid. Neutral salts behave in
different ways according to the concentration of the
solution and to the amount of clay (pelinite) present
in the slip. If the slip contains so little water as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
be in the form of a thin paste, neutral salts usually
have but a small action, but when the slip contains
only a small proportion of clay (pelinite) the presence
of neutral salts will tend to cause the precipitation of
the clay. In this way salts act in two quite different
directions according to the concentration of the slip.</p>

<p>On drying a paste made of clay and water the
volume gradually diminishes until the greater part
of the water has been removed; after this the
remainder of the water may be driven off without any
further reduction in volume of the material. This is
another characteristic common to colloidal substances
such as gelatin. The material when drying attains
a leathery consistency which is at a maximum at the
moment when the shrinkage is about to cease; on
further drying the material becomes harder and more
closely resembles stone.</p>

<p>Providing that wet clay is not heated to a
temperature higher than that of boiling water it
appears to undergo no chemical change and on cooling
it will again take up water<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and be restored to its
original condition except in so far as its colloidal
nature may have been affected by the heating. If,
however, the temperature is raised to about 500&deg; C.
a decomposition of the material commences and water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
is evolved. This water&mdash;which is commonly termed
'combined water'&mdash;is apparently an essential part of
the clay-molecule and when once it has been removed
the most important characteristics of the clay are
destroyed and cannot be restored. The reactions
which occur when clay is heated are complex and
are rendered still more difficult to study by the
apparent polymerization of the alumina formed.
Mellor and Holdcroft (<a href="#Bibl_29">29</a>) have recently investigated
the heat reactions of the purest china clay obtainable
and confirm Le Chatelier's view (<a href="#Bibl_10">10</a>) that on heating
to temperatures above 500&deg; C. clay substance decomposes
into free silica, free alumina and water, the
two former undergoing a partial re-combination with
formation of sillimanite (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>2</sub>) if a temperature
of 1200&deg; C. is reached. Mellor and Holdcroft point
out that there is no critical point of decomposition for
clay substance obtained from china clay, as it appears
to lose water at all temperatures, though its decomposition
proceeds at so slow a rate below 400&deg; C. as to
be scarcely appreciable.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Some clays are highly hygroscopic and absorb moisture readily
from the atmosphere. According to Seger (<a href="#Bibl_7">7</a>) this hygroscopicity
distinguishes true clay from silt and dust.</p></div>

<p>After the whole of the 'combined water' has been
driven off, if the temperature continues to rise, it is
found that at a temperature of 900&deg; C. an evolution of
heat occurs. This exothermal point, together with
the endothermal one occurring at the temperature at
which the decomposition of the clay seems to be most
rapid, has been found by Le Chatelier, confirmed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Mellor and Holdcroft, to be characteristic of clay
substance derived from kaolin and china clay, and the
two last-named investigators state that it serves as
a means of distinguishing kaolinite or clayite from
other alumino-silicates of similar composition. These
thermal reactions have not, as yet, been fully studied
in connection with plastic clays; with china clay, as
already noted, they probably indicate a polymerization
of the alumina set free by the decomposition of the
clay substance, as pure alumina from a variety of
sources has been found by Mellor and Holdcroft to
behave similarly.</p>

<p>On still further raising the temperature of
pure clay (pelinite or clayite) no further reactions of
importance occur, the material being practically
infusible. If, however, any silica, lime, magnesia,
alkalies, iron oxide or other material capable of combining
with the alumina and silica is present as
impurities in the clay substance, combination begins
at temperatures above 900&deg; C. This causes a reduction
of the heat-resisting power of the material;
the silicates and alumino-silicates produced fuse and
begin to react on the remaining silica and alumina,
first forming an impermeable mass in place of the
porous one produced with pure clay substance, and
gradually, as the material loses its shape, producing
a molten slag if the 'clay' is sufficiently impure.
As ordinary clays are never quite free from metallic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
compounds other than alumina, this formation of a
fused portion&mdash;technically known as <i>vitrification</i>
(<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>)&mdash;occurs at temperatures depending on the
nature of the materials present, so that a wide range
of products is obtained, the series commencing with
the entirely unfused pure clay (china clay), passing
through the slightly vitrified fireclays, the more completely
vitrified ball clays to the vitrifiable stoneware
clays and ending with materials so rich in easily
fusible matter as scarcely to be worthy of the name
of clays.</p>

<p>The constitution of the clay molecule is a subject
which has attracted the attention of many investigators
and is being closely studied at the present time.
It is a subject of peculiar difficulty owing to the
inertness of clay substance at all but high temperatures,
and to the complexity of reactions which take
place as soon as any reagent is brought into active
connection with it.</p>

<p>Without entering into details regarding the various
graphic formulae which have been suggested, it is
sufficient to state that the one which is most probably
correct, as far as present knowledge goes, is Mellor's
and Holdcroft's re-arrangement of Groth's formula (<a href="#Bibl_30">30</a>)</p>

<div class="fig_center">
<img src="images/formula1.png" width="194" height="92"  alt="Groth's Formula"  />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>which on removal of the hydroxyl groups might be
expected to give the anhydride</p>

<div class="fig_center">
<img src="images/formula2.png" width="155" height="62"  alt="Anhydride Formula"  />
</div>

<p>though in practice this substance&mdash;if formed at all&mdash;appears
to be instantly split up into Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>By regarding the aluminium as a nucleus, as above,
and some aluminium silicates as hypothetical alumino-silicic
acids, as suggested by Ulffers, Scharizer,
Morozewicz (<a href="#Bibl_29">29</a>) and others, clay substance may be
conveniently considered, along with analogous substances,
as forming a special group quite distinct from
the ordinary silicates. In this way Mellor and Holdcroft
(<a href="#Bibl_29">29</a>) consider that clay substance is not a
hydrated aluminium silicate&mdash;as is usually stated in
the text-books&mdash;but an alumino-silicic acid, the salts
of which are the zeolites and related compounds.
From this hypothesis it naturally follows that clay
substance is analogous to colloidal silica which has
been formed by the decomposition of a silicate by
means of water and an acid.</p>

<p>If this view be correct, pure clay substance or true
clay is a tetra-basic alumino-silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>9</sub>
or Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(0H<sub>4</sub>). That its acid properties are not
readily recognizable at ordinary temperatures is due
to its inertness; at higher temperatures its power of
combination with lime, soda potash and other bases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
is well recognized, though the reactions which occur
are often complicated by decompositions and molecular
re-arrangements which occur in consequence of
the elevated temperature.</p>

<p>There are a number of minerals which closely
resemble clayite or pure clay substance in composition,
the chief difference being in the proportion of
water they evolve on being heated. Thus <i>Rectorite</i>
H<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, <i>Kaolinite</i> H<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, <i>Halloysite</i> H<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>10</sub>
and <i>Newtonite</i> H<sub>10</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. In the crystalline form
these minerals may be distinguished from each other
by means of the microscope, but as the chief
materials of which clays are composed appears to be
amorphous it is impossible to ascertain with certainty
whether a given specimen of clay substance is composed
of a mixture of these analogous minerals in
an amorphous form or whether it consists entirely of
clayite, <i>i.e.</i> the clay substance obtained from china
clay. As already stated, the thermal reactions
which occur on heating clayite appear to be characteristic
of kaolinite whilst halloysite is completely
decomposed at a temperature somewhat below 200&deg; C.;
but the not improbable presence of two or more of
these alumino-silicic acids in clays of secondary or
multary origin makes it almost impossible to determine
whether clayite is an essential constituent of
all clays or whether the purest clay substance (pelinite)
obtained from some of the more plastic clays does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
not possess a different chemical composition as well
as different physical properties.</p>

<p>The view that clays may be regarded as impure
varieties of clayite is considered erroneous by
several investigators for various reasons. For
instance, felspar is rarely found in china clays, but
is a common constituent of secondary (plastic) clays.
J. M. van Bemmelen (<a href="#Bibl_26">26</a>), who has found that the
alumina-silica ratio of clays produced by weathering
is always higher than that in clays of the china clay
type produced by hypogenic action. In a number of
clays examined he found that a portion was soluble
in boiling hydrochloric acid whereas clayite is scarcely
affected by this treatment. He also found a varying
proportion of alumino-silicate insoluble in hydrochloric
acid but dissolved on treatment with boiling sulphuric
acid and subsequently with caustic soda solution;
this latter he considers to be true clayite. Unfortunately,
his results were obtained by treating
the crude clay with acid, instead of first removing
such non-plastic materials as can be separated by
washing, so that all that they show is that some clays
contain alumino-silicates of a nature distinct from
clayite in addition to any clayite which may be found
in them.</p>

<p>The fact that all clays when heated to 700 or 800&deg; C.
readily react with lime-water to form the same
calcium silicates and aluminates indicates so close a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
resemblance between the clay substance obtainable
from different sources as to constitute strong evidence
of the identity of this substance with clayite or with
materials so analogous to it as to be indistinguishable
from it under present conditions.</p>

<p>In all probability, the plastic clays have been
derived from a somewhat greater variety of minerals
than the primary clays (<a href="#Page_71">p. 71</a>) and under conditions
of decomposition which differ in details, though
broadly of the same nature as those producing china
clays. The presence of colloidal matter suggests a
more vigorous action&mdash;or even a precipitation from
solution&mdash;instead of the slower reactions which result
in the formation of the kaolinite crystals.</p>

<p>The much smaller particles present in plastic
clays also indicate a more complete grinding during
the transportation of the material or some form of
precipitation. If, as Hickling suggests, all clays are
direct products of the decomposition of <i>mica</i>, the fact
that several varieties of mica are known and that the
conditions under which these decompose must vary
considerably, afford a good, if incomplete, explanation
of some of the widely diverse characteristics observed
in different clays.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great complexities of the
whole subject and the apparently contradictory
evidence concerning some clays, there is a wide-spread
feeling that whatever may be the mineral from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a given clay has been derived, the <i>true clay substance</i>,
which is its essential constituent, would (if it could
be isolated in a pure state) prove to be of the same
composition as kaolinite obtainable from china clay
of exceptional purity. The purest clay substances
(pelinite) yet obtained from some of the most plastic
clays are, however, so impure as to make any detailed
investigation of their composition by present methods
abortive. The methods of synthesis which have proved
so successful in organic chemistry have hitherto
yielded few intelligible results with clays, on account
of the complexity of the accessory reactions which
occur.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Difference between Pure Clay Substance
and Ordinary Clays.</span></p>

<p>The properties and characteristics of <i>true clay</i>
are very seriously modified by other materials which
may be associated with it. This may be perceived
by comparing the properties of clays mentioned in
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter <span class="smcap">I</span></a> with those of various forms of true clay
just given. Moreover, as true clay never occurs in a
perfectly pure state in nature, the properties of clays
must be largely dependent on the accessory ingredients.</p>

<p>Silica, for example, when alone is a highly refractory
material, but in the presence of true clay it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
reduces the refractoriness of the latter. Lime has a
similar effect though its chemical action on the clay
is entirely different. A very small proportion of some
substances&mdash;notably the oxides of sodium and potassium&mdash;will
greatly alter the behaviour of true clay
when heated and will produce an impervious mass
in place of a porous one.</p>

<p>For these reasons, it is necessary in studying clays
to pay attention to both their physical and chemical
properties and to separate the material into fractions
so that each of these may be studied separately and
their individual as well as their collective characteristics
ascertained. Failure to do this has been the
cause of much obscurity and confusion in investigations
on certain clays composed of a considerable
proportion of non-argillaceous material which ought
to have been separated before any attempt was made
to study the true clay present.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, a considerable difference
between a natural clay and the pure clay substance
theoretically obtainable from it; this difference being
most marked in the case of low-grade brick clays of
glacial origin, which may contain 50 per cent. or more
of adventitious materials. If used in a natural state
they would be found to be valueless on account of
their impurities giving them characteristics of a
highly undesirable character, whereas the true clay
in them is found&mdash;in so far as it can be separated&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
bear a close resemblance to that obtained from a high
grade, plastic, pottery clay. Unfortunately, it is, at
present, impossible to isolate this clay substance in
anything approaching a pure form, and many clays
are without commercial value because of comparatively
small proportions of impurities which cannot
be separated from the clay substance without
destroying the latter.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Classification of Clays.</span></p>

<p>Owing to the widely differing substances from
which clays can, apparently, be formed and the
peculiar difficulties which are experienced in investigating
the nature of clay substance from different
sources, it is by no means easy to devise a scheme of
classification of clays, though many of these have been
attempted by different scientists.</p>

<p>The classification adopted by geologists is based
on the fossil remains and on the stratigraphical
position of clays relative to other rocks, as described
in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter <span class="smcap">II</span></a>. This is of great value for some purposes,
but the composition of the substances termed 'clay'
by geologists differs so greatly, even when only one
formation is considered, as to make their classification
of little or no use where the value or worthlessness of
the material depends upon its composition. Thus the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
so-called Oxford clay ranges from a hard silicious
shale to a comparatively pure clay; some portions
of it are so contaminated with calcareous and
ferruginous matter as to make the material quite
useless for the potter or clayworker. A geological
classification of clays is chiefly of value as indicating
probable origins, impurities and certain physical
properties; but the limits of composition and general
characteristics are so wide as to make it of very
limited usefulness.</p>

<p>The classification of clays on a basis of chemical
composition is rendered of comparatively little value
by the large number of clays which occupy ill-defined
borders between the more clearly marked classes.
Moreover, attempts to predict the value and uses
of clays from their chemical composition are generally
so misleading as to be worse than useless, unless
a knowledge of some of the physical characters of
the clays is available. It is, of course, possible to
differentiate some clays from others by their composition,
but not with sufficient accuracy to permit of
definite and accurate classification.</p>

<p>A classification based exclusively on the composition
of clays is equally unsatisfactory for other
reasons, the chief of which is the placing together of
clays of widely differing physical character, and the
separation of clays capable of being used for a particular
purpose. To some extent the latter objection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
may be disregarded, though it is of great importance
in considering the commercial value of a clay.</p>

<p>Classification based on the uses of clays of different
kinds has been suggested by several eminent ceramists,
but is obviously unsatisfactory, particularly as it is
by no means uncommon to use mixtures of clays and
other minerals for some purposes. Thus stoneware
clays must be vitrifiable under conditions which may
be defined with sufficient accuracy, but many manufacturers
of stoneware do not use clays which are
naturally vitrifiable; they employ a mixture of refractory
clay and other minerals to obtain the material
they require.</p>

<p>A classification based on the origin of clays
regarded from the petrological point of view offers
some advantages, but is too cumbersome for ordinary
purposes and suffers from the disadvantage that the
origin of some important clays is by no means clearly
known.</p>

<p>The author prefers a modification of Grimsley's and
Grout's classification (<a href="#Bibl_31">31</a>) as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="caption2nc">I.  Primary clays.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>a</i>)  Clays produced by 'weathering' silicates&mdash;as some kaolins.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>b</i>)  Clays produced by lateritic action&mdash;very rich in alumina,
some of which is apparently in a free state.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>c</i>)  Clays produced by telluric water containing active gases
(hypogenically formed clays)&mdash;as Cornish china clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption2nc">II.  Secondary clays.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>d</i>)  Refractory<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> secondary clays&mdash;as fireclays and some pipe
clays.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>e</i>)  Pale-burning non-refractory clays&mdash;as pottery clays, ball
clays and some shales.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>f</i>) Vitrifiable clays&mdash;as stoneware clays, paving brick clays.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>g</i>)  Red-burning and non-refractory clays&mdash;as brick and terra-cotta
clays and shales.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>h</i>)  Calcareous clays or marls, including all clays containing
more than 5 per cent. of calcium carbonate.</p>

<p class="caption2nc">III.  Residual clays.</p>

<p class="smaller">(<i>i</i>)  Clays which have been formed by one of the foregoing actions
and have been deposited along with calcareous or other matter but,
on the latter being removed by subsequent solution, the clay has
remained behind&mdash;as the white clays of the Derbyshire hills.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> A refractory clay is one which does not soften sufficiently to
commence losing its shape at any temperature below that needed to
bend Seger Cone 26 (approximately 1600&deg;C.) (see <a href="#Page_116">p. 116</a>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some further sub-division is necessary for special
purposes, particularly in sections <i>e</i>, <i>f</i> and <i>h</i>, but to
include further details would only obscure the general
scheme. Some clays will, apparently, be capable of
classification in more than one section, thus a vitrifiable
clay may owe its characteristic to a high
proportion of calcium carbonate and so be capable of
inclusion as a calcareous clay. Broadly speaking, however,
if the clay is tested as to its inclusion in each
section of the scheme in turn it will be found that its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
highest value will be in the section which is nearest
to the first in which the clay can legitimately be
placed.</p>

<p>From a consideration of a classification such as
the foregoing, together with a detailed study of the
physical and chemical properties of the material as a
whole, and also of the various portions into which it
may be divided&mdash;particularly that which has been
isolated by mechanical methods of purification and
separation&mdash;it is not difficult to gain a fairly accurate
idea of the nature of any clay. Although the present
state of knowledge does not permit them to be
classified with such detail as is the case with plants,
animals, or simple chemical compounds, the study
of clays and the allied materials has a fascination
peculiarly its own, not the least interesting features
of which are those properties of the clay after it has
been made into articles of use or ornament. These
are, however, beyond the scope of what is commonly
understood by the term 'the natural history of clay.'</p>
